----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
'Human, All Too Human is the monument of a crisis.' With these apt words 
Nietzsche began his own reflection, in his autobiographical Ecce Homo 
(1888),' on this remarkable collection of almost 1t400 aphorisms published 
in three instalments, the first of which had appeared in 1878, ten years 
earlier. The crisis to which he refers was first and foremost a crisis of 
multiple dimensions in his own life. Human, All Too Human was the extended 
product of a period of devastating health problems that necessitated 
Nietzsche's resignation in 1879 from his professorship in classical philology 
at Basel University. These problems were to plague him for the remaining 
decade of his brief productive life (which ended with his complete physical 
and mental collapse in January 1889, at the age of 44, from which he never 
recovered in the eleven years of marginal existence that remained to him 
before his death in 1900). Human, All Too Human also marked Nietzsche's 
transition from the philologist and cultural critic he had been into the kind 
of philosopher and writer he came to be. 
But the crisis was above all a crisis in Nietzsche's intellectual develop­
ment; and although it was very much his own, it presaged the larger crisis 
toward which he came to see our entire culture and civilization moving, and 
subsequently came to call 'the death of God'.> In his own case, this crisis was 
precipitated not only by his deepening appreciation of the profound and 
extensive consequences of the collapse of traditional ways of thinking, but 
also -and more immediately -by his growing recognition of the in­
sufficiency of the resources of both the Enlightenment and the Romanticism 
to which he had been so strongly attracted to fill the void. The three 
instalments of Human, All Too Human are no less important for the insight 
they yield into the kind of struggle in which Nietzsche was engaged than 
they are for the many sparks that fly in the course of his efforts to find new 
ways to go on. 
The world  around Nietzsche did not appear to be a world  headed for 
crisis. The ordeals, horrors and dramatic changes of the century to come 
were largely unimagined, and indeed unimaginable, even to Nietzsche, who 
was far more prescient than most-even to the point of deeming the advent 
of air travel to be inevitable (1:267). In 1876, when he began working on the 
material that was published two years later in what is now the first volume 
of Human, All Too Human, Europe was again at (relative) peace. It had been 
ten years since the Austro-Prussian War that had left Prussia dominant in 
Central Europe; and it had been five years since the brief Franco-Prussian 
vii Page 4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
War (in which Nietzsche had briefly served as a volunteer medical orderly, 
with disastrous consequences for his health), which further enhanced and 
extended Prussia's sway,  this time at France's expense. German unification 
under Prussian leadership had been achieved in 1871, and the new Reich 
appeared to be thriving, with Wilhelm on the throne and (more importantly) 
Otto von Bismarck at the helm. 
Everything seemed to be coming along very nicely for Western civiliza­
tion in general, Europe in particular and Germany more specifically. It was 
the heyday of European imperialism, with India recently incorporated into 
the British Empire, and much of the rest of the non-Western world coming 
under European sway. The industrial revolution was sweeping all before 
it, and capitalism was triumphant. New technologies and modes of 
transportation and communication were transforming Western societies. 
(Nietzsche himself must have been one of the very first philosophers to own 
one of the newly invented typewriters, although it proved to be of little use 
to him.) Despite the success of conservative elements of European societies 
in retaining their social position and political power, forces preparing the 
way for their  eventual replacement by more popular forms of social, 
cultural, economic and political organization-for better or for worse -were 
gathering. 
The physical sciences were advancing spectacularly; and while the 
influence of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud had yet to be felt, the social and 
historical disciplines were maturing, and the biological sciences were 
coming on strong. Charles Darwin already loomed large. His Origin of Species 
had been published in 1859, and his Descent of Man in 1871. Germany, 
making up for lost time, was emerging as an economic, political and tech­
nological powerhouse, as well as the world's new leader in many of the 
sciences. It also continued its century-long dominance in philosophy, with 
ever-mutating forms of idealism, neo-Kantianism, naturalism and material­
ism competing in the aftermath of Hegel. Religion, enjoying official state 
status in many countries and the unquestioning allegiance of the vast 
majority of their populations, seemed immune from serious challenge. The 
arts, literature and music were flourishing as well, in Germany as elsewhere 
in Europe; and in 1876 the frenzy surrounding Richard Wagner -to which 
Nietzsche was no stranger -rose to new heights, with the opening of 
Bayreuth, and the performance of the first complete  four-opera cycles of 
Wagner's monumental Ring of the Nibulungs. 
Yet Nietzsche was convinced that all was far from well. He was repelled 
by the popular culture and brave new social, economic and political world 
burgeoning around him, and could no longer take seriously the intellectual 
and religious tradition associated with it. By 1876 he also found himself 
increasingly estranged  from the newly  fashionable alternatives to the 
tradition that its critics and rivals had been touting, including his erstwhile 
idols and mentors Arthur Schopenhauer and Wagner. Everywhere he 
looked, even at those things and thinkers supposedly representing the pride 
of our culture and the zenith of humanity, what he saw was not only far 
from divine but all-too-human.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
Nietzsche had long yearned -and continued to yearn throughout his 
productive life -for a higher humanity with a worth great enough to 
warrant the affirmation of life even in the absence of any transcendently 
supplied meaning. He now had come to the hard realization that the only 
possible way to that higher humanity required an uncompromising exam­
ination of everything human and all-too-human that at once stands in our 
way and is our point of departure, and a sober stocktaking of what there is 
to work with in undertaking what he was later to call the enhancement of 
human life. The idea and ideal he seized upon at this juncture to guide and 
accompany him was that of the 'free spirit', older and wiser heir of the 
Enlightenment. Nietzsche paid explicit tribute to the ethos of this newly 
adopted lineage in his dedication of the first edition of Human, All Too Human 
to Voltaire, Enlightenment thinker par excellence, who had died exactly a 
century earlier, and whose spirit he now embraced. 
Human, All Too Human was Nietzsche's second book; and it was as far 
removed from the kind of book professors of classical languages and litera­
tures were supposed to write as anything could be. His first book, The Birth 
of Tragedy (1872), had been a scandal in the eyes of his scholarly colleagues 
owing to its disregard of prevailing norms of scholarship and its blatant 
advocacy of Wagner as the reincarnation of the spirit of the tragic culture of 
the Greeks-but it at least had a recognizably classical literary topic. Human, 
All Too Human, as initially published, was a volume of 638 aphorisms-that 
is, short observations and reflections ranging from one or two sentences to 
a long paragraph, of a relatively self-contained nature. This style was a 
radically new one for Nietzsche, reminiscent of the writings of such 
observers  of the human scene as Montaigne and La Rochefoucauld. 
Nietzsche had long greatly admired their manner of thought and expres­
sion, and found himself drawn to emulate them in his search for a voice that 
lent itself both to his own changing temperament and circumstances and to 
the decidedly unphilological tasks towards which he was turning. 
The publication of Human, All Too Human completed Nietzsche's estrange­
ment from his erstwhile scholarly profession, from which he officially retired 
shortly thereafter. It also completed his much more painful estrangement 
from Wagner, whose devoted admirer, champion and intimate younger 
friend  Nietzsche had been. Nietzsche himself claimed to have begun 
writing the book in reaction to the first Bayreuth production of Wagner's 
Ring cycle, the entire social spectacle of which appalled him; and although 
he in fact would appear to have begun work on it some months earlier, in 
the spring of 1876, it certainly was written during a period in which his 
formerly close relationship to Wagner had become severely strained. 
Nietzsche knew that Wagner would loathe the book; and its dedication 
to Voltaire was undoubtedly a  very deliberate gesture of defiance and 
independence in Wagner's direction. Eight years after its first publication, 
when Nietzsche republished it, he dropped the dedication-perhaps because 
he no longer wanted Voltaire to be taken as paradigmatic of his evolving 
conception of the 'free spirit', but perhaps also because Wagner by then had 
died, and such gestures were no longer either needed or fitting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
In his discussion in Ecce Homo of the 'crisis' of which Human, All Too 
Human was the 'monument', Nietzsche goes on to say of it: 'Here I liberated 
myself from what in my nature did not belong to me.' He had given Human, 
All Too Human the subtitle 'A Book for Free Spirits'; and he went on to 
characterize the 'free spirit' in similar language, as 'a spirit that has become 
free, that has again taken possession of itself'.3 Among the things he clearly 
had in mind were his attachments to Schopenhauer and Wagner, who had 
been at the centre of his intellectual life for the previous decade. They had 
been the subjects of his last two major publications prior to Human, All Too 
Human, in which he had lavished praise upon them even while privately 
beginning to distance himself from them: Schopenhauer as Educator ( 1874) and 
Richard Wagner in Bayreuth (1876), the final two essays of his four-part 
Untimely Meditations. 
A student of classical languages and literatures rather than of philosophy, 
it had been Nietzsche's accidental discovery of Schopenhauer's magnum 
opus The World as Will and Representation in 1865 that had introduced -and 
seduced-him to philosophy. His spiritual seduction by Wagner three years 
later (in 1868) influenced him even more profoundly. The spell cast upon 
him by the two of them together is very apparent both in his thinking and 
enthusiasms in The Birth of Tragedy and in the fact that he ventured to write 
and publish such a book. Nietzsche's father had died when he was a young 
child; and he in effect  adopted Schopenhauer as his intellectual godfather 
and Wagner as his emotional and spiritual father figure. It was for good 
reason that it occurred to him to write in aphorism 381 of the first volume 
of Human, All Too Human: 'Correcting nature.-If one does not have a good 
father one should furnish oneself with one.' Yet by the time he wrote these 
words he was well beyond this point, attempting to liberate himself from 
the fathers with whom he had furnished himself. 
It is well worth bearing in mind who the Nietzsche was who published 
this book of aphorisms in 1878. Neither he nor anyone else had the slightest 
idea of what he would go on to do and become. He was a 33-year-old 
philology  professor whose health and academic career were both failing 
badly. His youthful  vigour and promise were now but sadly faded 
memories to his professional colleagues. His only book, published six years 
earlier, was the scandalous Birth of Tragedy; and his only subsequent 
publications of any significance were the two essays just mentioned and two 
previous 'untimely meditations', David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer 
(1873) and On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life (1874). His 
enthusiasm for and association with Wagner had earned him a certain 
notoriety, but it had done him no good academically; and he otherwise had 
little reputation at all, except perhaps as a gamble that had appeared not to 
be working out. He was not thought of as a philosopher, having had no 
philosophical training and having published nothing  resembling a con­
ventional philosophical treatise. He had written a short, ambitious but 
sketchy essay, 'On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense', several years 
earlier; but it remained unfinished, and he never did publish it. His thoughts 
had indeed begun to tum toward philosophy, and he had even gone so far 
X Page 7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
as to apply for the Chair in Philosophy at Basel when it became vacant; but 
he was unsuccessful in this attempt to switch professions, for reasons that 
are easy enough to understand. 
Even if Human, All Too Human had been  published by a professional 
philosopher, it very probably would not have been regarded as a contribu­
tion to the philosophical literature by academic philosophers either in 
Nietzsche's own time or subsequently. Nor is it clear that it should be; for 
there is much in it that does not seem to have much to do with philosophi­
cal matters. Even the ideas on philosophical topics it addresses are seldom 
presented in recognizably philosophical ways. More of it can be seen as 
having philosophical relevance in retrospect, particularly if one looks back 
upon it with Nietzsche's later writings in mind, and if one's idea of 
philosophical relevance has been influenced by the impact of his thinking 
with respect to the philosophical enterprise. Even so, however, all three 
instalments of the work are very much the product of a mind in transition, 
moving in many different directions and in many different ways, heedless 
of disciplinary boundaries and norms, with only Nietzsche's interests and 
intellectual conscience as his map and compass. 
The aphoristic form Nietzsche adopted (and adapted to his purposes) in 
Human, All Too Human had long been a favoured literary form of observers 
of the human scene who preferred to comment incisively on many things, 
rather than writing essays about a selected few. But this form may also have 
been virtually necessitated by Nietzsche's increasingly severe and disabling 
health problems, which frequently rendered him incapable of writing or 
even thinking for extended periods of time. He had to make maximum use 
of the short periods of respite that came to him between frequent and 
extended bouts of misery. He struggled to surmount his wretched condition, 
and did so to much greater effect than most people in his situation could; 
but it was a hard and tortured struggle, giving poignant significance to his 
subsequent emphasis upon 'hardness', self-mastery, self-discipline, and to 
his refusal to become preoccupied and deterred by suffering. The flair he 
discovered in himself for aphoristic writing at this time thus accorded well 
with necessity. It would be unwarranted, however, to assume  that 
Nietzsche's recourse to it is indicative of the absence of any underlying unity 
and coherence of thought and intention  here and subsequently. So he 
himself observes in aphorism 128 of the second instalment, very much to 
this point: 'Against the shortsighted. -Do you think this work must be frag­
mentary because I give it to you (and have to give it to you) in fragments?' 
Nietzsche had long been plagued by poor eyesight and eye pain that 
would afflict him when he either read or wrote extensively, by migraine 
headaches and by indigestion and other gastric problems that made him pay 
a high price for departures from the blandest of diets. His problems were 
compounded by a variety of ailments -dysentery and diphtheria among 
them-he contracted while serving as an orderly during the Franco-Prussian 
War, the effects of which continued to plague him. And the syphilis he seems 
somehow to have acquired (despite leading a virtually celibate life), that was 
the likely cause of his final collapse a dozen years later, may well have begun 
xi Page 8
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
to contribute to the deterioration of his health during the gestation period 
of Human, All Too Human. 
So Nietzsche went from one health crisis to another, finding the rigours 
and burdens of his academic position increasingly difficult to bear, despite 
the fact that he rarely  had as many as a  dozen students attending  his 
lectures. He often was unable to read or write, and frequently was obliged 
to take medical leaves from his teaching. His collapses were all too common, 
and at times he was virtually an invalid. He visited clinics,  spas and 
specialists, whose diagnoses and prescriptions may often have only made 
things  worse. Alternating bouts of blinding headaches and wracking 
vomiting would last for days; and his lecturing became ever more sporadic 
and difficult. Finally, in the spring of 1879, he submitted his resignation, 
receiving a small pension that was his sole income thereafter. He then left 
Basel and began the nomadic life -moving from boarding-house to board­
ing-house in search of the right climate and conditions -that he would lead 
for the decade of active life remaining to him prior to his collapse. 
It is miraculous that anyone with such severe problems and living such a 
life could have written anything at all, let alone the series of brilliant books 
that Nietzsche managed to complete in this period, beginning with the first 
volume of Human, All Too Human. And to all of this must be added the 
publication history of these books, which compounds the miracle. This 
history  was  troubled by Nietzsche's often strained  relations with his 
publishers and printers, and plagued by such other all-too-human difficul­
ties as his eye problems, requiring him to resort to dictation much of the 
time, and to reliance on the assistance of others to put his manuscripts 
together, as well as making proof-reading a torment. But worst of all, 
Nietzsche's publication history is a veritable chronicle of failure. A recent 
study by William Schaberg makes all of this painfully clear, setting out the 
whole long and  sorry  story in depressing detail.4 The Birth of Tragedy sold 
modestly well, and attracted a good deal of attention -even if much of it 
was hostile. But the same cannot be said of any of Nietzsche's subsequent 
books, during his sentient lifetime. Prior to his collapse, none of them sold 
more than a few hundred copies, and few of them attracted any attention 
whatsoever. 
Human, All Too Human is a vivid case in point. Of the 1,000 copies in the 
first printing of the original version, only 120 were sold in 1878; and more 
than half remained unsold in 1886,  when Nietzsche reacquired them and 
repackaged them with a new introduction as the  first volume of the two­
volume second edition. The supplement he published in 1879 under the 
subtitle' Assorted Opinions and Maxims' sold even more poorly: of the 1,000 
copies printed, only a third had been sold by 1886. The second supplement 
The Wanderer and His Shadow, published a year later, fared even worse: fewer 
than 200 of its initial 1,000 copies had  been sold by 1886, when Nietzsche 
acquired the rights to both supplements and republished them with a new 
introduction, as the second volume of the second edition of Human, All Too 
Human. There was no true reprinting of additional copies until1893, when 
another printing of 1,000 copies of the combined work was run; and its 
xii Page 9
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
sales remained slow even after his later works began to receive more 
attention. 
Human, All Too Human attained greater circulation and availability as part 
of the editions of his collected works that began to appear after Nietzsche's 
death; but it was long eclipsed by The Birth of Tragedy before it and by Thus 
Spoke Zarathustra and its sequels after it, both in Europe and in the English­
speaking world. The same is true of the other two works in Nietzsche's' free 
spirit' series, Daybreak and The Gay Science. The neglect of Human, All Too 
Human in the English-speaking world is at least partly owing to Walter 
Kaufmann's lack of interest in it. It was through his translations and his 
widely read study Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist, first 
published in 1950, that many English-speaking readers after World War II 
became interested in and acquainted with Nietzsche. Kaufmann translated 
Nietzsche's first book, The Birth of Tragedy, and virtually everything 
Nietzsche published from The Gay Science onward; but he never got. around 
to translating any of the things Nietzsche published in the interval, during 
the crucial period in which he published not only the three instalments of 
Human, All Too Human but also the four Untimely Meditations and Daybreak, 
except for brief excerpts which he inserted in other volumes. Indeed, even 
Kaufmann's translation of The Gay Science was something of an afterthought, 
appearing long after most of his other translations.5 
Kaufmann can hardly be blamed for having the interests he did, and for 
the things he did not choose to do; but they had consequences, since there 
were no other readily available complete translations of Human, All Too 
Human or Daybreak in English until the early 198os, when Marion Faber 
translated the first volume of Human, All Too Human (published by the 
University of Nebraska Press) and Hollingdale's Cambridge University 
Press translations appeared. Their long inaccessibility ensured that these 
works, and Nietzsche's thinking during the period in which he wrote them, 
would remain virtually unknown to English-speaking readers during the 
preceding three decades. (They likewise had been virtually invisible 
previously, when Nietzsche was known mainly second-hand in the English­
speaking world, and was commonly assumed to be the proto-Nazi he had 
been made out to be by Nazi propaganda.) 
The problem was compounded by Kaufmann's treatment of Human, All 
Too Human (and Daybreak and The Gay Science as well) in his popular 
intellectual-biographical study, which had little competition for nearly two 
decades. This entire period, for Kaufmann, was a gestation period in 
Nietzsche's thought, of little interest in its own right. He appears to have 
deemed it deserving of comment at all chiefly for the anticipations to be 
found in some aphorisms of ideas that became prominent in his later 
thinking, and for the ammunition other aphorisms afford that were useful 
in combating Nietzsche's Nazi misinterpretation. So Human, All Too Human 
is relegated to a few pages, in a chapter entitled 'Discovery of the Will to 
Power'. 'There would be little sense', Kaufmann wrote (without explana­
tion), 'in trying here to sample the gems of Human, all-too-Human or 
[Daybreak).' He restricted himself to asserting, with a few illustrations, that, 
xiii Page 10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
'Proceeding quite unsystematically and considering each problem on its 
own merits,  without a theory to prove or an axe to grind, Nietzsche reverts 
now and then to explanations in terms of what he was later to call a will to 
power.'6 The works of this period, for Kaufmann, were of significance 
primarily as the record of Nietzsche's development from the author of The 
Birth of Tragedy into a psychological thinker on a par with Freud, with his 
further transformation into a philosopher coming somewhat later. 
There certainly is some truth in this. Human, All Too Human undeniably 
does show us Nietzsche as psychologist both under development and at 
work, inventing a kind of psychologizing for which he found a wealth of 
applications all around him-socially, culturally, behaviourally, intellectually, 
even philosophically-and simultaneously inventing himself as a new kind 
of thinker capable of employing this sort of analysis to fascinating and 
important effect. He was not operating in a void. He had some brilliant 
aphoristic predecessors, the inspiration of such Enlightenment exemplars as 
Voltaire, and the benefit of reading his 'educator' and philosophical­
psychological mentor Schopenhauer. He also had the more immediate 
example and encouragement of his newfound friend Paul Ree, who had 
just  written a book in a somewhat similar spirit entitled Psychological 
Observations. Ree's influence was readily and profusely acknowledged by 
Nietzsche, who went so far as to say that his own position at this time could 
be called 'Reealism'; and it was evident to all who knew him-including the 
Wagners, who bitterly lamented it (all the more because Ree was Jewish). 
But the results were much more than the sum of their influences even here. 
And they also added up to something that was much more than psychology 
as well. It is true enough that Nietzsche's thinking continued to develop, 
even from one book to the next in this period, as well as over the course of 
the next  decade; and that, as Kaufmann maintained, Nietzsche's philo­
sophical maturity was yet some time off. Yet his accomplishment in the three 
instalments of Human, All Too Human is remarkable in its own right, and can 
stand on its own feet. If he had died without publishing another thing (as 
might very well have happened), it would have been sufficient to earn him 
an important place in the intellectual history of the past several centuries -
even if a somewhat different one than he has come to have. 
The gulf that separates this work from Nietzsche's previous published 
writings is wide. The enthusiasms, aspirations and assumptions that so 
strikingly pervade and animate his earlier work are no longer in evidence. 
It is a much more sober and analytical, colder and wiser thinker who is at 
work here. Its author is still hopeful of finding both a diagnosis and a cure 
to what ails our culture and threatens its future, and resists Schopenhauer's 
pessimism; but he is as disillusioned now with Wagner, the new Reich and 
other pied pipers of modern times as he earlier had been with traditional 
religious consolations and their philosophical cousins. He has become 
convinced that only something like a continuation and radicalization of 
Enlightenment thinking, getting to the bottom  of  things and ruthlessly 
exposing all false hopes and dangerous palliatives, can afford us at least the 
possibility of a future worth having and a life worth living. Nietzsche's 
xiv Page 11
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
dedication to Voltaire was more than a slap at Wagner (although that it 
surely was). It also was the announcement of a major intellectual re­
orientation, placing him squarely in the often calurnnied but courageous 
tradition of Enlightenment thought and effort. 
For the Nietzsche of Human, All Too Human nothing is beyond criticism­
and there is a strong suspicion that (as he would later put it) all 'idols' of our 
reverence will tum out to be hollow and all-too-human when subjected to 
critical scrutiny. His new 'psychological' tools are brought to bear upon 
them, with results that amply support this suspicion. But there is more 
to the outlook and way of thinking that he is devising and putting into 
practice here than this. In 'On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense', some 
five years earlier, Nietzsche had begun sketching a fundamentally and 
severely naturalistic picture of our general human condition, in a world over 
which no benevolent deity reigns and in which no beneficent rationality is 
at work. We are depicted as alone and adrift in a godless universe, a mere 
cosmic accident, ill-equipped either to comprehend what is going on or to 
do much about it; and we are kidding ourselves if we think otherwise -
although we seem almost irresistibly drawn to do so. Can we live without 
such illusions? Nietzsche was at first inclined to doubt it-as one sees in The 
Birth of Tragedy, written at about the  same time. 
By the time of Human, All Too Human, he seems to have resolved to try. 
The power of myths and illusions to sustain anyone possessed of an un­
compromising intellectual conscience is undermined when one sees through 
them; and so one may have little other choice, if -as for Nietzsche -
Kierkegaardian leaps of faith are out of the question, and a Schopenhauerian 
negation of life is repellent. Human, All Too Human is a work of cold passion, 
in which nothing more is assumed about our humanity than the picture 
sketched in the 'Truth and Lies' essay, and in which everything in human 
life that might seem to be of loftier origins is called before the tribunal of 
scrutiny, with humbling results. Yet the spirit  of the investigation is 
profoundly and pervasively affirmative; for the passion that drives it is not 
only that of an honesty that will tolerate no nonsense or groundless wishful 
thinking, but also of a desperate search for enough to work with and ways 
of doing so to sustain ourselves despite all. To call this 'secular humanism' 
would be to sell it short; for while Nietzsche's outlook is radically secular, 
he is far from taking humanity either in general or as embodied in each and 
every one of us to be the locus of meaning and value. But it is a kind of tough­
minded and yet doggedly affirmative naturalism, the upshot of which is that 
our all-too-human humanity leaves a good deal to be desired, and yet gives 
us something to work with that is not to be despised. 
But if we are to make something worthwhile of ourselves, we have to take 
a good hard look at ourselves. And this, for Nietzsche, means many things. 
It means looking at ourselves in the light of everything we can learn about 
the world and ourselves from the natural  sciences -most emphatically 
including evolutionary biology, physiology and even medical science. It also 
means looking at ourselves in the light of everything we can learn about 
human life from history, from the social sciences, from the study of arts, 
XV Page 12
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
religions,  languages,  literatures, mores and other features of various 
cultures. It further means attending closely to human conduct on different 
levels of human interaction, to the relation between what people say and 
seem to think  about themselves and what they do, to their  reactions in 
different sorts of situations, and to everything else about them that affords 
clues to what makes them tick. All of this, and more, is what Nietzsche is up 
to in Human, All Too Human. He is at once developing and employing the 
various perspectival techniques that seem to him to be relevant to the under­
standing of what we have come to be and what we have it in us to become. 
This involves gathering materials for a reinterpretation and reassessment of 
human life, making tentative efforts along those lines and then trying them 
out on other human phenomena both to put them to the test and to see what 
further light can be shed by doing so. 
This multi-perspectival and multi-directional method, which Nietzsche 
employed with increasing dexterity and ingenuity  throughout the re­
mainder of his productive life, finds its first extended trials and applications 
in Human, All Too Human. The results are uneven, as one might expect-and 
indeed as is always the case in Nietzsche's writings (or, for that matter, in 
the case of anyone who engages in such a complex, uncertain and adven­
turesome sort of interpretive enterprise). Distinguishing between genuine 
insights and personal preferences, prejudices, over-generalizations, 
irresistible puns and other such inspirations is not easy. It often can be done 
better by others than by oneself -even if one's intellectual conscience is as 
alert and vigorous as Nietzsche's, to whom the all-too-human was no 
stranger. But by precept and example he invites us to subject him to the same 
sort of scrutiny to which he subjects others; and that is something many will 
want to do. He only asks that one be prepared to have one's very objections 
subjected in turn to the same searching critical assessment-for they too may 
be questionable. 
Nietzsche himself looked back on Human, All Too Human twice in print. 
The final time was in his rather creatively and grandiosely self-interpretive 
Ecce Homo, in 1888, in the course of a review of all of his main publications 
under the characteristically immodest  heading 'Why I Write Such Good 
Books'. The occasion of his first subsequent retrospective-the reissuing of 
all three instalments together in 1886-may itself have had its all-too-human 
motivations (not the  least of which was Nietzsche's hope that by re­
packaging them with new prefaces he might be able to sell more of them 
and attract more attention to them). Nonetheless, the two new prefaces he 
wrote on this occasion are of no little  interest; and it is important  for 
readers to bear in mind that they were written long after the material they 
precede-eight years after the first volume, and six and seven years after the 
two parts of the second volume. Indeed, the prefaces themselves were 
written at· different times and places-the former in Nice, on the French 
Mediterranean coast in Spring 1886, and the latter in Sils Maria, in the 
mountainous Swiss Engadine region, in September of that year. They both 
deserve close reading, both before and after one has made one's way through 
the maze of the 1,400 aphorisms.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
In the first preface Nietzsche sees himself at the time of the first volume 
as already burdened with the large and heavy questions that compelled him 
toward philosophy, and also as struggling to achieve the intellectual and 
spiritual freedom and resources needed to deal with them, which he feels 
he had lacked in sufficient measure previously. He also sees himself as 
having been in a precarious state of health both physically and intellectually, 
slowly convalescing from the maladies of both sorts that had threatened to 
engulf him. The same theme is sounded again in the second preface; and 
there he makes it even clearer what the chief dangers were to which he had 
to develop resistance and learn to overcome. He refers to these writings as 
'a continuation and redoubling of a spiritual cure, namely of the anti-roman­
tic self-treatment that my still healthy instinct had itself discovered and 
prescribed for me against a temporary attack of the most dangerous form of 
romanticism', and as the expressions of a 'courageous pessimism' that is the 
'antithesis of all romantic mendacity' (u:P:2, 4). 
As Nietzsche observes in the first preface, his determination to resist and 
reject all such temptations (which for him could be summed up in a single 
name: Wagner) was still immature here, and was not yet 'that mature 
freedom of spirit which is equally self-mastery and discipline of the heart 
and permits access to many and contradictory modes of thought', and which 
he evidently feels he subsequently had come to attain (1: P: 4). But he sees 
himself in Human, All Too Human as having been on the way to it. And it is 
of no little importance to the understanding of Nietzsche both to observe 
that he not only places this interpretation upon the direction and outcome 
of his own intellectual development, and to recognize what is fundamental 
to it: the repudiation of 'all romantic mendacity', and its replacement by the 
cultivation of the intellectual conscience and analytical, critical and 
interpretive abilities of the 'free spirit' he was attempting to become and 
conjure among his readers by his own example. 
Nietzsche thus saw himself here as having turned away from the 
Wagnerian-Schopenhauerian Romanticism of The Birth of Tragedy (of which 
he was explicitly critical along these very lines in a new preface to that work 
also written in 1886, entitled' Attempt at a Self-Criticism'). In doing so, and 
partly as a way of doing so, he had turned with all the self-discipline and 
intellect he could muster in an analytical direction, replacing art with 
science as his new paradigm of high spirituality. Thus, in the preface to the 
second volume, he refers to the various instalments of Human, All Too Human 
as 'precepts of health that may be recommended to the more spiritual natures 
of the generation just coming up as a disciplina voluntatis [discipline of the 
will]' (n:P:2). It is a discipline as much needed today as it was needed by 
Nietzsche himself and by 'the generation just coming up' in his own time. 
This in part answers the question of the intended audience of these 
volumes. Nietzsche did not think of himself, either at this time or later, as 
writing primarily for professional philosophers, or even for students  in 
philosophy courses. He clearly was moving in what he conceived to be a 
philosophical direction; but he was writing first and foremost for inquiring 
and adventuresome minds of sufficient sophistication to keep pace with him, 
xvii Page 14
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
whoever and wherever they may be-not only in academia but also among 
the intelligent reading public. He hoped in particular to be able to reach the 
better minds of the younger generation, who might be more receptive than 
their elders to challenges to preconceived ideas and assumed values. Yet he 
also had hopes of having the sort of wider impact Voltaire and other fire­
brands of the Enlightenment had had a century earlier. 
At the same time Nietzsche worried about what the likes of the Wagners 
and the few colleagues who had not given up on him would think of it. For 
a time he even considered publishing the first volume anonymously or 
under a pseudonym. Human, All Too Human may not seem to us today to be 
scandalously radical, however provocative it may be on some topics; but at 
the time Nietzsche rightly feared that it would be deeply offensive to many 
of its readers -not in the ways The Birth of Tragedy had been to his fellow 
philologists, but in an almost opposite way. Now it was those who had been 
enamoured of Nietzsche the romantic who were offended, by his abandon­
ment of Romanticism in favour of a coldly and severely analytical 
Naturalism-for which he sought the widest possible audience. Beyond the 
circle of those who already knew of him, however, Nietzsche need not have 
worried about the scandalousness of his new venture -for, to his dismay, 
no one else paid the slightest attention. Even today, few recognize it as the 
gold mine it is, not only as an excellent way of becoming acquainted with 
his thinking, but also for its wealth of ideas worth thinking about. 
It does not do full justice to these ideas to characterize them as 'psycho­
logical', let alone as revolving around the 'discovery of the will to power' 
(as Kaufmann  suggests). Nietzsche himself, in his 1886 preface to the first 
volume,  observes that although he may not have realized it at the time, it 
eventually dawned upon him that 'it is the problem of order of rank' -that is, 
the problem of values and their revaluation and ordering-'of which we 
may say it is our problem'; and that, to position themselves to address this 
problem adequately, 'we free spirits' first have to become' adventurers and 
circumnavigators of that inner world called "man", as surveyors and 
[measurers] of that "higher" and "one [above] the other" that is likewise 
called "man"-penetrating everywhere, almost[!] without fear, disdaining 
nothing, losing nothing, asking everything, cleansing everything of what is 
chance and accident in it and as it were thoroughly sifting it ... ' (1:P7). 
That is a fair characterization of what Nietzsche does in Human, All Too 
Human; and it is in that sense that the term 'psychological' applies to  his task 
and way of going  about  it. 'Psychology' in his time, after all, was not a 
discipline in its own right, separate and distinct from philosophy, but rather 
was conceived both loosely and strictly as a part of it; and in Nietzsche's 
hands it retained this intimate  connection with philosophy as he came to 
understand and practice it. Philosophy for  him revolves around the 
exploration of things human, and is first and foremost the attempt to 
comprehend them -even if that comprehension is not an end in itself. It 
prepares the way for the further comprehension of the whole complex 
matter of value, as it relates to issues of quality and worth in and about 
human  life, in the service of its enhancement. In Human, All Too Human 
xviii Page 15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
Nietzsche took (and in his prefaces saw himself as taking) major steps in that 
direction. He had yet to learn to temper his new enthusiasm for the natural 
sciences, to figure out how to revisit the perspectives relating to the arts and 
culture he had known so well without becoming captive once again to them, 
to supplement both with yet others and to develop the ability to make larger 
interpretive sense of our humanity in the light of this multiplicity of 
perspectives upon it. But he was on his way. 
This assessment of the place of Human, All Too Human in the context of 
Nietzsche's larger intellectual development has the virtues of acknowledging 
the great differences  between it (and its companion volumes in the 'free 
spirit' series) and his earlier writings, and also of coherently relating his later 
writings to both. Many readers -and interpreters -make the mistake of 
regarding these 'free spirit' works as a kind of interlude between The Birth 
of Tragedy and Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and of reading them-if at all-from 
the perspective of his later writings, in relation to which they are generally 
found to pale by comparison, both rhetorically and philosophically. It would 
make a good deal more sense to view his later writings in the perspective of 
his 'free spirit' works, taking Human, All Too Human as one's point of de­
parture, and regarding Zarathustra as an interlude between the last of them 
(the first four-part  version of The Gay Science) and the continuation of 
Nietzsche's aphoristic works, beginning with Beyond Good and Evil and the 
expanded version of The Gay Science he published a year later. For the 
continuities between them are strong, even if Nietzsche's arsenal of 
perspectives grows, his philosophical sophistication increases, his rhetoric 
sharpens and heats up, and his intellectual pendulum swings back from its 
scientifically-oriented extreme point in the direction of his artistic and cultural 
concerns and sensibility (moving subsequently in considerably shorter arcs 
in the general vicinity of the centre of the spectrum they mark out). 
This even applies to the organization of Human, All Too Human and the 
two later works that are not devoted to specific topics or figures, Beyond Good 
and Evil and Twilight of the Idols. Like  both of them, the  first version of 
Human, All Too Human does have an organization, in the form of the divi­
sion of the volume into parts with headings. Interestingly enough, all three 
have the same number of major parts -nine -plus an epilogue. And there 
is a striking similarity among the headings as well. Each starts out with 
sections on topics relating to philosophers and philosophy; each has a section 
relating to morality, and another to religious and metaphysical matters; each 
has a section on social and political matters, and another on cultural and 
intellectual topics; and each, at some point, contains a collection of one­
liners on a variety of sensitive topics guaranteed to offend almost everyone. 
To be sure, the parallels are not exact; but they are close enough to warrant 
the suggestion of a continuity of form -and in content there are not only 
significant differences but also remarkable similarities. One might well ask 
oneself in what ways Nietzsche's thinking changed on these matters from 
his initial discussions of them in Human, All Too Human to Beyond Good and 
Evil to Twilight, what his reasons may have been (if he does not make them 
explicit)-and whether the changes were invariably for the better. 
xix Page 16
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
The two parts of the second volume of Human, All Too Human were not 
supplied with the same sorts of headings, or indeed with any subheadings 
at all. Most of the aphorisms in them can easily be assigned to one or another 
of those Nietzsche uses in the first volume, however; for they chiefly range 
over and fall into the same general topics. An examination of the list of these 
topics makes it clear both that Human, All Too Human is far from being as 
formless as it is often taken to be, and also that Nietzsche's interests include 
but are not restricted to issues that are normally deemed 'philosophical'. The 
first (appropriately enough), 'Of First and Last Things', deals with 
metaphysical thinking -but in a curiously detached sort of way, more as a 
phenomenon to be understood than a set of arguments to be engaged head 
on. The same sort of approach is taken to morality in the second ('On the 
History of Moral Sensations'-Nietzsche's first go at what he came to call 
the 'genealogy of morals'); to religion in the third ('The Religious Life'); and 
to art in the fourth ('From the Souls of Artists and Writers'). In each case 
Nietzsche is proposing that we make  the experiment of looking at these 
seemingly sublime things as human phenomena-experiences and activities 
of human beings-asking what is going on when such things occur in human 
life, and shifting the presumption from their sublimity to the suspicion that 
their appearance of sublimity may well be deceiving. 
In the next four sections Nietzsche turns his attention to the domain of 
cultural, social and interpersonal relationships and types. There is more to 
culture than  art and literature; and he attempts to bring it into  focus in the 
fifth section ('Tokens of Higher and Lower Culture'). Social institutions and 
relationships are the logical next stop, in the sixth section ('Man in Society'), 
with family matters coming next ('Woman and Child'), followed by politi­
cal life(' A Glance at the State'). If in the first four sections he surveys things 
that claim some sort of transcendent significance, of the sort Hegel sought 
to express in his characterization of their domain as that of 'absolute 
spirituality', here Nietzsche surveys those things that flesh out what Hegel 
had called 'the life of a people' on the level of its 'objective spirituality'. These 
too are among the chief sorts of things in terms of which our humanity and 
human meaning and worth are commonly conceived. If one asks what it is 
that sets us apart from and above other creatures whose existence is merely 
animal, and is not permitted to give a quick religious or metaphysical answer 
appealing to transcendent principles and powers, this is a fair inventory of 
possible answers. That is the larger (and genuinely if unconventionally 
philosophical) point of these collections of reflections, many of which might 
not appear to have any philosophical significance whatsoever. 
In the final section Nietzsche turns to what he considers to be left after one 
has considered all of these other dimensions of human life: what we are or 
can be on our own, as individuals, within or by ourselves ('Man Alone with 
Himself'). Later he would add another item to the  first  four on the list, 
belonging with them, but not yet as problematical in his eyes as he subse­
quently recognized it to be: scientific thinking, of the very sort he had become 
so enamoured of and reliant upon here. Like the glasses with which one may 
be provided to deal with vision problems, and to which one may become so 
XX Page 17
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
accustomed that one ceases to be aware of them, this sort of thinking can 
come to be taken for granted beyond the point to which reliance upon it is 
warranted. To his great credit, Nietzsche was far quicker than most to 
become sensitive to the limitations of ways of thinking to which he was 
attracted -and then, having done so, to get past his disappointment with 
them and ascertain the best uses that might be made of them, their limita­
tions notwithstanding. In Human, All Too Human, however, his romance with 
the sciences was still young, and this process had yet to run its course. 
The expression Nietzsche adopted to characterize the kind of thinker and 
human being he conceived himself to have become '-or at any rate to have 
been on the way to becoming-at the time of Human, All Too Human is that 
which he features in its subtitle: 'free spirit', Freigeist. Human, All Too Human 
is proclaimed in its subtitle to be 'A Book for Free Spirits'. Three years after 
the publication of its first instalment, when Nietzsche published the first 
version of The Gay Science, he had the following printed on the back cover: 
'This book marks the conclusion of a series of writings by FRIEDRICH 
NIETZSCHE whose common goal it is to erect a new image and ideal of the free 
spirit.' He then went on to list Human, All Too Human and its supplements 
and sequels up to and including The Gay Science? 
But this did not mark the end of Nietzsche's attachment to the idea of the 
'free spirit'. It reappears very significantly in Beyond Good and Evil, as the 
heading of the second part of the book in which, following his largely 
critical first part 'On the Prejudices of Philosophers', he proceeds to set forth 
a variety of his own ideas on a broad range of philosophical issues. And it 
reappears again not only in his retrospective Ecce Homo, as one would expect, 
but also in Twilight of the Idols, in a section bearing the heading 'My concep­
tion of freedom'.8 From first to last it is invoked to convey the double mean­
ing of both liberation from things that have tended to hinder and hobble one, 
and of determination to undertake tasks requiring independence, strength, 
courage and imagination. Nietzschean free spirits are not necessarily 
philosophers; but Nietzschean philosophers are necessarily free spirits. 
Voltaire, for Nietzsche, was an exemplary free spirit, as the original dedica­
tion of Human, All Too Human indicated: 'To Voltaire's memory, in com­
memoration of the day of his death, 30 May q88.' His example would 
appear to have taught Nietzsche the erstwhile devoted disciple of Wagner 
something he came to realize he badly needed to learn. 
The 'free spirit' is 'a spirit that has become free', as Nietzsche emphasizes 
in his remarks on Human, All Too Human in Ecce Homo. In the things that 
matter most, Rousseau was both right and wrong -right in observing that 
people are 'everywhere in chains', but wrong in supposing them to be 'born 
free'. True freedom of the spirit is something that is acquired-if at all-with 
difficulty, and only by a few. Indeed, in Nietzsche's 1886 preface to the first 
volume he even goes so far as to allow that he was obliged to invent the' free 
spirits' to whom the book is addressed, since "'free spirits" of this kind do 
not exist, did not exist' -although he says 'I had need of them', all the more 
so because he lacked the kind of actual companionship and comradeship 
that people of this sort could provide. 'That free spirits of this kind could one 
xxi Page 18
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION 
day exist', on the other hand, and indeed that they will one day exist, he does 
not doubt. 'I see them already coming', he optimistically asserts (1: P: 2); and 
in any event the statement on the back cover of The Gay Science makes it clear 
enough that he hoped and intended Human, All Too Human to speed the day, 
by both precept and example. 
But the same could be said for all of Nietzsche's aphoristic works, after as 
well as before Thus Spoke Zarathustra. It is perhaps less true of Zarathustra 
itself, despite Zarathustra's repeated proclamations that he wants no 
disciples and wants his companions to think for themselves; for it is hard 
(though not impossible) to read and experience Zarathustra as a non­
tendentious work. And it likewise is perhaps less  true of Nietzsche's 
polemical later works-against Wagner, against Christianity and even (in 
On the Genealogy of Morals) against the kind of morality he considered to have 
come to prevail in the Western world. Polemics may have their place in the 
liberation of fettered spirits  from  the shackles that bind them, and so in 
making it possible for some people who might not otherwise do so to become 
free spirits; but they are far from sufficient to complete the process, and can 
easily subvert it-as the responses of many people to what they find in some 
of Nietzsche illustrate well enough. 
Unfortunately for Nietzsche's reception, his free-spirited side has all too 
often been overshadowed and even eclipsed by the appearance of a much 
more impassioned and seemingly dogmatic side, frightening some and 
exciting others -for equally dubious reasons in either case. Neither the fact 
that this appearance has been seen in markedly different (and incompatible) 
ways, nor the objection that it is only an appearance rather than the dark 
side of the reality of his thought, has sufficed to keep it from long impeding 
his interpretation and assessment. The best remedy for this predicament is 
to direct attention to those works in which Nietzsche is engaged in his free­
spirited labours, from Human, All Too Human to The Gay Science and Beyond 
Good and Evil to Twilight of the Idols. This is not to expurgate him; for there is 
plenty in each of these books to worry about and argue with, and much that 
is all-too-human in him no less than in his targets. But in these volumes he 
for the most part carries on in the manner of the kind of 'free spirit' he seeks 
to evoke and encourage. If one would understand the sort of thing he has in 
mind in speaking of philosophers and philosophy of the future as he would 
have them be, one would do well to begin -as he did -with this idea in 
mind, as the presupposition of anything further that a Nietzschean kind of 
philosophy might involve. 
There is no better commentary in Nietzsche on what free-spiritedness 
meant to him, as the idea took shape in and beyond Human, All Too Human, 
than the paragraph with which he concludes the part of Beyond Good and Evil 
entitled 'The Free Spirit'. It deserves to be read together with the prefaces to 
the two volumes of Human, All Too Human he shortly went on to write. With 
them in mind one can  turn to Human, All Too Human itself and see why 
Nietzsche was not content to allow it to go unnoticed even after he had gone 
on to publish a good many other things -and why there may be no better 
introduction to his thought and thinking.

Intellectual background 
The history of philosophy has few chapters as rich and varied as that of 
German (or Central European) philosophy from Kant to Nietzsche. A superb 
survey of German philosophy up to and including Kant is Lewis White 
Beck's Early German Philosophy: Kant and his Predecessors (Cambridge, MA, 
1969). The next chapters of the story are well told by Frederick C. Beiser in 
The Fate of Reason: German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte (Cambridge, MA, 
1987); G. A. Kelly in Idealism, Politics and History: Sources of Hegelian Thought 
(Cambridge, 1969) and Herbert Schnadelbach in Philosophy in Germany 
1831-1933 (Cambridge, 1984). 
Two classic studies of German philosophy in the nineteenth century, both 
first published in 1941, are Herbert Marcuse's Reason and Revolution: Hegel 
and the Rise of Social Theory (Boston, 1960) and Karl Lowith's From Hegel to 
Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Thought (New York, 1964). 
More recent studies include Walter Kaufmann's From Shakespeare to 
Existentialism (Garden City, NY, 1959), Maurice Mandelbaum's History, Man 
and Reason (Baltimore, 1971), and Robert Solomon's From Rationalism to 
Existentialism (New York, 1972). 
The two most important figures in Nietzsche's intellectual life and devel­
opment were Arthur Schopenhauer and Richard Wagner. Useful studies of 
Schopenhauer include  Patrick Gardiner's Schopenhauer (Baltimore, 1963), 
D. W. Hamlyn's Schopenhauer (London, 1980) and Christopher Janaway's 
Self and World in Schopenhauer (Oxford, 1989). On Wagner, see Ernest 
Newman's four-volume biography The Life of Richard Wagner (New York, 
1933-46 ), and Geoffrey Skelton's Wagner at Bayreuth (London and New York, 
1976). The many studies of the Nietzsche-Wagner relationship include 
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's Wagner and Nietzsche (New York, 1976) and 
Frederick Love's The Young Nietzsche and the Wagnerian Experience (Chapel 
Hill, 1963). Roger Hollinrake discusses all three of them in Nietzsche, Wagner 
and the Philosophy of Pessimism (London, 1982). 
Nietzsche himself published essays on both Schopenhauer and Wagner, 
shortly before Human, All Too Human, although they both reveal much more 
about the Nietzsche of that period of his life than they do about 
Schopenhauer and Wagner themselves. They are the third and fourth of his 
Untimely Meditations (Cambridge, 1983), and bear the titles 'Schopenhauer 
as Educator' and 'Richard Wagner in Bayreuth'. Late in his productive life

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FURTHER READING 
(though only fifteen years after the appearance of the latter essay), Nietzsche 
also published two short books as polemically critical of Wagner as his early 
essay had been appreciative: The Case of Wagner (New York, 1967) and 
Nietzsche Contra Wagner, included in Walter Kaufmann's The Portable 
Nietzsche (New York, 1954). 
Nietzsche's life 
Perhaps the best recent biography of Nietzsche is Ronald Hayman's 
Nietzsche: A Critical Life (New York, 1980). Another useful and shorter 
biography is R. J. Hollingdale's Nietzsche (London, 1965). Kaufmann's 
Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist (Princeton, 1950; Princeton, 
1974), a kind of intellectual biography, is the book that rehabilitated 
Nietzsche for the post-World War II generation in the English-speaking 
world, and remains one of the most accessible introductions to his life and 
thought. 
Here again, Nietzsche himself has also supplied a contribution that can­
not go unmentioned, even if it is no more reliable and no less tendentious 
than his writings on Schopenhauer and Wagner. It is his intellectual­
autobiographical Ecce Homo (New York, 1967), to which he gave the subtitle 
'How One Becomes What One Is'. It is the last book he completed before his 
collapse. Considered by some to be all too clearly indicative of his incipient 
insanity, it is regarded by others as a work of profound significance. In any 
event, it is well worth reading. 
Nietzsche's writings 
Most of Nietzsche's publications have been translated into English in a 
number of versions, the best of which have long been generally considered 
to be the translations made by Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale 
(sometimes in collaboration). A monumental critical edition of his writings 
in German has been published by De Gruyter, edited by Giorgio Colli and 
Mazzino Montinari; and a translation project intended to result in an 
English-language counterpart has now begun, under the editorship of Ernst 
Behler, at Stanford University Press. 
Other writings of Nietzsche's that will be of particular interest to readers 
of the present work certainly include the two similar works following it in 
what Nietzsche came to think of and refer to as his 'free spirit' series: 
Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality (Cambridge, 1982), also trans­
lated by Hollingdale; and The Gay Science (New York, 1974), translated by 
Kaufmann. Nietzsche's earlier writings are well worth consulting as well, 
for the indications they provide of the concerns which shaped the direction 
of his thinking and efforts in this series of aphoristic volumes. Chief among 
them are his first book (1872), The Birth of Tragedy (New York, 1967), trans­
lated by Kaufmann, and a series of four essays (first published in the years 
1873-6) Nietzsche gathered together in 1886 under the title Untimely 
Meditations (Cambridge, 1983), translated by Hollingdale. They also include 
xxvii Page 24
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FURTHER READING 
a draft of an important early essay Nietzsche never finished or published, 
which however reveals the starkly naturalistic picture of the human con­
dition  that  was a part of his point of departure: 'On Truth and Lies in a 
Nonmoral Sense' (1873), translated by Daniel Breazeale and included in his 
volume Nietzsche, Philosophy and Truth (Atlantic Highlands, NJ, 1979). 
Following his 'free spirit'  series, Nietzsche turned his attention to a very 
different sort of project: his extraordinary four-part literary-philosophical 
experiment and masterpiece, Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883-5), translated 
(among  others) by both Kaufmann (in The Portable Nietzsche) and 
Hollingdale (Harmondsworth, 1961). He then (1886) returned to the publi­
cation of volumes of a somewhat aphoristic nature, beginning with Beyond 
Good and Evil, which again has been translated by both Kaufmann (New 
York,  1966) and Hollingdale (Harmondsworth, 1973), and an expanded 
version of The Gay Science. His next book, On the Genealogy of Morals (1887), 
translated by Kaufmann and Hollingdale together (New York, 1967), joins 
his aphoristic style to a three-essay format with a more specific focus than 
any of his previous aphoristic works (published in 1994, trans. Carol Diethe, 
edited by Keith Ansell-Pierson). In the final year before his collapse (1888) 
Nietzsche not only published the two polemics against Wagner and the auto­
biographical Ecce Homo mentioned above, but also a polemical critique of 
Christianity, The Antichrist, and a final volume of aphorisms more in the 
tradition of Human, All Too Human, which (parodying Wagner's fourth Ring 
opera) he called Gotzendiimmerung, or Twilight of the Idols. Both of these last 
works have been translated by Kaufmann (in The Portable Nietzsche) and also 
by Hollingdale (Harmondsworth, 1¢8). 
Which of these many things should one read after Human, All Too Human? 
That depends upon one's interests. If one is primarily interested in matters 
relating to morality, one might look first at Daybreak, then at the fifth and 
ninth parts of Beyond Good and Evil and then at On the Genealogy of Morals. 
On religion, Daybreak again is a good sequel, together with the sections of 
The Gay Science dealing with God and religion, the third part of Beyond Good 
and Evil and The Antichrist. On the many philosophical topics relating to 
knowledge, our world and ourselves, one might look back to the early essay 
'On Truth and Lies', and ahead to The Gay Science, the first two parts of 
Beyond Good and Evil and Twilight of the Idols; and one might also take a look 
at the selections from Nietzsche's notebooks from the 188os published under 
the title The Will to Power, translated by Kaufmann and Hollingdale (New 
York, 1967). And for an indication of Nietzsche's thinking with respect to 
the enhancement of life and the possibility of a 'higher humanity' he 
discerns along with the 'all too human' tendencies he examines here and 
subsequently, one might look back to his essay 'Schopenhauer as Educator' 
(the third of his Untimely Meditations) as well as to Thus Spoke Zarathustra. 
Nietzsche's thought 
Nietzsche has been so influential in so many ways during the course of the 
twentieth century, and has been so variously interpreted; that no one 
xxviii Page 25
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FURTHER READING 
account can be considered authoritative. He has been claimed as originator, 
anticipator, inspiration and kindred spirit by fascists and humanists, 
existentialists and deconstructionists, critical theorists and analytical 
philosophers, and by more artists, writers and composers than any other 
figure in the history of philosophy (at least since Plato). Both his admirers 
and his critics can make persuasive arguments for and against him; but they 
all too often fail to take the trouble to read him thoroughly and attentively 
enough to understand him -or at any rate to earn the right to make their 
claims. 
Walter Kaufmann's  classic  study Nietzsche (mentioned  above) offers a 
readable interpretation of Nietzsche's thought along humanistic existen­
tialist and pragmatist lines. Another early study of enduring value, which 
explores Nietzsche's thought more systematically, is George Morgan's What 
Nietzsche Means (Cambridge, MA, 1941; New York, 1965). Useful interpre­
tations in the analytic tradition include Arthur Danto's Nietzsche as 
Philosopher (New York, 1965), Alexander Nehamas's Nietzsche: Life as 
Literature (Cambridge, MA, 1985), Maudemarie Clark's Nietzsche on Truth 
and Philosophy (Cambridge, 1990), and Richard Schacht's Nietzsche (London 
and New York, 1983) and Making Sense of Nietzsche (Urbana and Chicago, 
1995). A sampling of interpretations along post-structuralist and de­
constructionist lines may be found in David Allison's  collection The New 
Nietzsche: Contemporary Styles of Interpretation (New York, 1977). Helpful 
recent studies of various aspects of Nietzsche's thought relating to matters 
he discusses in Human, All Too Human include Erich Heller's The Importance 
of Nietzsche (Chicago, 1988), Peter Bergmann's Nietzsche: The Last Antipolitical 
German (Bloomington, IN, 1987) and Lester Hunt's Nietzsche and the Origin 
of Virtue (London, 1991).

1 
I have been told often enough, and always with an expression of great 
surprise, that all my writings, from the Birth of Tragedy* to the most re­
cently published Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future, t have something that 
distinguishes them and unites them together: they all of them, I have 
been given to understand, contain snares and nets for unwary birds and 
in effect a persistent invitation to the overturning of habitual evaluations 
and valued habits. What? Everything only-human, all too human? It is 
with this sigh that one emerges from my writings, not without a kind of 
reserve and mistrust even in regard to morality, not a little tempted and 
emboldened, indeed, for once to play the advocate of the worst things: as 
though they have perhaps been only the worst slandered? My writings 
have been called a schooling in suspicion, even more in contempt, but 
fortunately also in courage, indeed in audacity. And in fact I myself do 
not believe that anyone has ever before looked into the world with an 
equally profound degree of suspicion, and not merely as an occasional 
devil's advocate, but, to speak theologically, just as much as an enemy 
and indicter of God; and anyone who could divine something of the con­
sequences that lie in that profound suspiciousness, something of the 
fears and frosts of the isolation to which that unconditional disparity of 
view condemns him who is infected with it, will also understand how 
often, in an effort to recover from myself, as it were to induce a temporary 
self-forgetting, I have sought shelter in this or that -in some piece of ad­
miration or enmity or scientificality or frivolity or stupidity; and why, 
where I could not find what I needed, I had artificially to enforce, falsify 
and invent a suitable fiction for myself (-and what else have poets ever 
done? and to what end does art exist in the world at all?). What I again 
and again needed most for my cure and self-restoration, however, was 
the belief that I was not thus isolated, not alone in seeing as I did -an 
enchanted surmising of relatedness and identity in eye and desires, a 
reposing in a trust of friendship, a  blindness in concert with another 
without suspicion or question-marks, a pleasure in foregrounds, sur­
faces, things close and closest, in everything possessing colour, skin and 
apparitionality. Perhaps in this regard I might be reproached with having 
employed a certain amount of 'art', a certain amount of false-coinage: for

example, that I knowingly-willfully closed my eyes before Schopen­
hauer' s" blind will to morality at a time when I was already sufficiently 
clearsighted about morality; likewise that I deceived myself over Richard 
Wagner'st incurable romanticism, as though it were a beginning and not 
an end; likewise over the Greeks, likewise over the Germans and their 
future-and perhaps a whole long list could be made of such likewises?­
Supposing, however,  that all this were true and that I was reproached 
with it with good reason, what do you know, what could you know, of 
how much cunning in self-preservation, how much reason and higher 
safeguarding, is contained in such self-deception-or of how much falsity 
I shall require if I am to continue to permit myself the luxury of my truthful­
ness? ... Enough, I am still living; and life is, after all, not a product of 
morality: it wants deception, it lives on deception ... but there you are, I 
am already off again, am I not, and doing what I have always done, old 
immoralist and bird-catcher that I am -speaking unmorally, extra­
morally,  'beyond good and evil'?-
2 
-Thus when I needed to I once also invented for myself the 'free spirits' to 
whom this melancholy-valiant book with the title Human, All Too Human 
is dedicated: 'free spirits' of this kind do not exist, did not exist-but, as I 
have said, I had need of them at that time if I was to keep in good spirits 
while surrounded by ills (sickness, solitude, unfamiliar places, acedia, in­
activity): as brave companions and familiars with whom one can laugh 
and chatter when one feels like laughing and chattering, and whom one 
can send to the Devil when they become tedious -as compensation for 
the friends I lacked. That free spirits of this  kind could one day exist, that 
our Europe will have such active and audacious fellows among its sons of 
tomorrow and the next day, physically present and palpable and not, as 
in my case, merely phantoms and hermit's phantasmagoria: I should 
wish to be the last to doubt it. I see them already coming, slowly, slowly; 
and perhaps I shall do something to speed their coming if I describe in 
advance under what vicissitudes, upon what paths, I see them coming?--
3 
One may conjecture that a spirit in whom the type 'free spirit' will one 
day become ripe and sweet to the point of perfection has had its decisive 
experience in a great liberation and that previously it was all the more a fet­
tered spirit and seemed to be chained for ever to its pillar and corner. 
What fetters the fastest? What bends are all but unbreakable? In the case 
of men of a high and select kind they will be their duties: that reverence 
proper to youth, that reserve and delicacy before all that is honoured and

was in his youth a disciple (see the essay, 'Schopenhauer as Educator' in the Untimely Medi­

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PREFACE 
revered from of old, that gratitude for the soil out of which they have 
grown, for the hand which led them, for the holy place where they 
learned to worship-their supreme moments themselves will fetter them 
the fastest, lay upon them the most enduring obligation. The great liber­
ation comes for those who are thus fettered suddenly, like the shock of an 
earthquake: the youthful soul is all at once convulsed, torn loose, torn 
away -it itself does not know what is happening. A drive and impulse 
rules and masters it like a command; a will and desire awakens to go off, 
anywhere, at any cost; a vehement dangerous curiosity for an undis­
covered world flames and flickers in all its senses. 'Better to die than to go 
on living here' -thus responds the imperious voice and temptation: and 
this 'here', this 'at home' is everything it had hitherto loved! A sudden 
terror and suspicion of what it loved, a lightning-bolt of contempt for 
what it called 'duty', a rebellious, arbitrary, volcanically erupting desire 
for travel, strange places, estrangements, coldness, soberness, frost, a 
hatred of love, perhaps a desecrating blow and glance backwards to where 
it formerly loved and worshipped, perhaps a hot blush of shame at what 
it has just done and at the same time an exultation that it has done it, a 
drunken, inwardly exultant  shudder which betrays that a victory has 
been won- a victory? over what? over whom? an enigmatic, question­
packed, questionable victory, but the first victory nonetheless: such bad 
and painful things are part of the history of the great liberation. It is at the 
same time a sickness that can destroy the man who has it, this first out­
break of strength and will to self-determination, to evaluating on one's 
own account, this will to free will: and how much sickness is expressed in 
the wild experiments and singularities through which the liberated pris­
oner now seeks to demonstrate his mastery over things! He prowls 
cruelly around with an unslaked lasciviousness; what he captures has to 
expiate the perilous tension of his pride; what excites him he tears apart. 
With a wicked laugh he turns round whatever he finds veiled and 
through some sense of shame or other spared and pampered: he puts to 
the test what these things look like when they are reversed. It is an act of 
willfulness, and pleasure in willfulness, if now he perhaps bestows his 
favour on that which has hitherto had a bad reputation -if, full of in­
quisitiveness and the desire to tempt and experiment, he creeps around 
the things most forbidden. Behind all his toiling and weaving-for he is 
restlessly and aimlessly on his way as if in a desert-stands the question­
mark of a more and more perilous curiosity. 'Can all values not be turned 
round? and is good perhaps evil? and God only an invention and finesse 
of the Devil? Is everything perhaps in the last resort false? And if we are 
deceived, are we not for that very reason also deceivers? must we not be 
deceivers?'-such thoughts as these tempt him and lead him on, even fur­
ther away, even further down. Solitude encircles and embraces him, ever 
more threatening, suffocating,  heart-tightening, that terrible goddess 
and mater saeva cupidinum .. -but who today knows what solitude is? ...

From this morbid isolation, from the desert of these years of temptation 
and experiment, it is still a long road to that tremendous overflowing cer­
tainty and health which may not dispense even with wickedness, as a 
means and fish-hook of knowledge, to that mature freedom of spirit 
which is equally self-mastery and discipline of the heart and permits 
access to many and contradictory modes of thought-to that inner spa­
ciousness and indulgence of superabundance which excludes the danger 
that the spirit may even on its own road perhaps lose itself and become 
infatuated and remain seated intoxicated in some corner or other, to that 
superfluity of formative, curative, moulding and restorative forces which 
is precisely the sign of great health, that superfluity which grants to the 
free spirit  the dangerous privilege of living experimentally and of being 
allowed to offer itself to adventure: the master's privilege of the free 
spirit! In between there may lie long years of convalescence, years full of 
variegated, painfully magical transformations ruled and led along by a 
tenacious will to health which often ventures to clothe and disguise itself 
as health already achieved. There is a midway condition which a man of 
such a destiny will not be able to recall  without emotion: it is charac­
terized by a pale, subtle happiness of light and sunshine, a feeling of bird­
like freedom, bird-like altitude, bird-like exuberance, and a third thing in 
which curiosity is united with a tender contempt. A 'free-spirit'-this cool 
expression does  one  good in every condition, it is almost warming. One 
lives no longer in the fetters of love and hatred, without yes, without no, 
near or far as one wishes, preferably slipping away, evading, fluttering 
off, gone again, again flying aloft; one is spoiled, as everyone is who has 
at some time seen a tremendous number of things beneath him-and one 
becomes the opposite of those who concern themselves with things 
which have nothing to do with them. Indeed, the free spirit henceforth 
has to s:lo only with things -and how many things! -with which he is no 
longer concerned ... 
5 
A step further in convalescence: and the free spirit again draws near to 
life-slowly, to be sure, almost reluctantly, almost mistrustfully. It again 
grows  warmer  around  him, yellower, as it were;  feeling and feeling for 
others acquire depth, warm breezes of all kind blow across him. It seems 
to him as if his eyes are only now open to what is close at hand. He is aston­
ished and sits silent: where had he been? These close and closest things: 
how changed they seem! what bloom and magic they have acquired! He 
looks back gratefully-grateful to his wandering, to his hardness and self­
alienation, to his viewing of far distances and bird-like flights in cold 
heights. What a good thing he had not always stayed 'at home', stayed 
'under his own roof like a delicate apathetic  loafer! He had been beside 
himself: no doubt of that. Only now does he see himself-and what sur­
prises he experiences as he does so! What unprecedented shudders! 
8 Page 35
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PREFACE 
What happiness even in the weariness, the old sickness, the relapses of 
the convalescent! How he loves to sit sadly still, to spin out patience, to lie 
in the sun! Who understands as he  does the happiness that comes in 
winter, the spots of sunlight on the wall! They are the most grateful ani­
mals in the world,  also the most modest, these convalescents and lizards 
again half turned towards life: -there are some among them who allow 
no day to pass without hanging a little song of praise on the hem of its 
departing robe. And, to speak seriously: to become sick in the manner of 
these free spirits, to remain sick for a long time and then, slowly, slowly, 
to become healthy, by which I mean 'healthier', is a fundamental cure for 
all pessimism (the cancerous sore and inveterate vice, as is well known, of 
old idealists and inveterate liars). There is wisdom, practical wisdom, in 
for a long  time prescribing even health for oneself only in small doses. -
6 
At that time it may finally happen that, under the sudden illumination of 
a still stressful, still changeable health, the free, ever freer spirit begins to 
unveil the riddle of that great liberation which had until then waited 
dark, questionable, almost untouchable in his memory. If he has for long 
hardly dared to ask himself: 'why so apart? so alone? renouncing every­
thing I once reverenced? renouncing reverence itself? why this hardness, 
this suspiciousness, this hatred for your own virtues?'-now he dares to 
ask it aloud and hears in reply something like an answer. 'You shall 
become master over yourself, master also over your virtues. Formerly 
they were your masters; but they must be only your instruments beside 
other instruments. You shall get control over your For and Against and 
learn how to display first one and then the other in accordance with your 
higher goal. You shall learn to grasp the sense of perspective in every 
value judgement-the displacement,  distortion and merely apparent tel­
eology of horizons and whatever else pertains to perspectivism; also the 
quantum of stupidity that resides in antitheses of values and the whole 
intellectual loss which every For, every Against costs us. You shall learn 
to grasp the necessary injustice in every For and Against, injustice as in­
separable from life, life itself as conditioned by the sense of perspective and 
its injustice. You shall above all see with your own eyes where injustice is 
always at its greatest: where life has developed at its smallest, narrowest, 
neediest, most incipient and yet cannot avoid taking itself as the goal and 
measure of things and for the sake of its own preservation secretly and 
meanly and ceaselessly crumbling away and calling into question the 
higher, greater, richer-you shall see with your own eyes the problem of 
order of rank, and how power and right and spaciousness of perspective 
grow into the heights together. You shall'-enough: from now on the free 
spirit knows what 'you shall' he has obeyed, and he also knows what he 
now can, what only now he -may do ...

7 
This is how the free spirit elucidates to himself that enigma of liberation, 
and inasmuch  as he generalizes his own case  ends by adjudicating on 
what he has experienced thus. 'What has happened to me', he says to 
himself, 'must happen to everyone in whom a task wants to become incar­
nate and "come into the world".' The secret force and necessity of this 
task will rule among and in the individual facets of his destiny like an 
unconscious pregnancy -long before he has caught sight of this task itself 
or knows its name. Our vocation  commands and disposes of us even 
when we do not yet know it; it is the future that regulates our today. 
Given it is the problem of order of rank of which we may say it is our problem, 
we free spirits: it is only now, at the midday of our life, that we under­
stand what preparations, bypaths, experiments, temptations, disguises 
the problem had need of before it was allowed to rise up before us, and 
how we first had to experience the most manifold and contradictory 
states of joy and distress in soul and body, as adventurers and circumna­
vigators of that inner world called 'man', as surveyors and guagers of that 
'higher' and 'one upon the other' that is likewise called 'man'-penetrat­
ing everywhere, almost without fear, disdaining nothing, losing noth­
ing, asking everything, cleansing everything of what is chance and 
accident in it and as it were thoroughly siftin,g it-until at last we had the 
right to say, we free spirits: 'Here- a new problem! Here a long ladder 
upon  whose  rungs we ourselves have sat and climbed -which we our­
selves  have at some time been! Here a higher, a deeper, a beneath-us, a 
tremendous long ordering,  an order of rank, which we see: here-our 
problem!' --

-No psychologist or reader of signs will have a  moment's difficulty in 
recognizing to what stage in the evolution just described the present 
book belongs (or has been placed-). But where today are there psycholo­
gists? In France, certainly; perhaps in Russia; definitely not in Germany. 
There is no lack of reasons as to why the Germans of today could even 
regard this fact as redounding to their honour: an ill fate for one who in 
this matter is by nature and attainment un-Gerrnan! This German book,

peoples-it has been on its way for about ten years-and must be capable 
of some kind of music and flute-player's art by which even coy foreign 
ears are seduced to listen -it is precisely in Germany that this book has 
been read most carelessly and heard the worst: why is that?-'It demands 
too much', has been the reply, 'it addresses itself to people who are not 
oppressed by uncouth duties, it wants refined and experienced senses, it 
needs superfluity, superfluity of time, of clarity in heart and sky, of

courteous a reply my philosophy advises me to keep silent and to ask no 
more questions; especially as in certain cases, as the saying has it, one 
remains a philosopher only by-keeping silent.

OF FIRST 
AND 
LAST THINGS 
Chemistry of concepts and sensations. -Almost all the problems of philos­
ophy once again pose the same form of question as they did two thou­
sand years ago: how can something originate in its opposite, for example 
rationality in irrationality, the sentient in the dead, logic in unlogic, dis­
interested contemplation in covetous desire, living for others in egoism, 
truth in error? Metaphysical philosophy has hitherto surmounted this 
difficulty by denying that the one originates in the other and assuming 
for the more highly valued thing a miraculous source in the very kernel 
and being of the 'thing in itself'.* Historical philosophy, on the other 
hand, which can no longer be separated from natural science, the 
youngest of all philosophical methods, has discovered in individual cases 
(and this will probably be the result in every case) that there are no op­
posites, except in the customary exaggeration of popular or metaphysical 
interpretations, and that a mistake in reasoning lies at the bottom of this 
antithesis: according to this  explanation  there  exists, strictly speaking, 
neither an unegoistic action nor completely disinterested contemplation; 
both are only sublimations, in which the basic element seems almost to 
have dispersed and reveals itself only under the most painstaking obser­
vation. All we require, and what can be given us only now the individual 
sciences have attained their present level, is a chemistry of the moral, re­
ligious and aesthetic conceptions and sensations, likewise of all the agi­
tations we experience within ourselves in cultural and social intercourse, 
and indeed even when we are alone: what if this chemistry would end up 
by revealing that in this domain too the most glorious colours are derived 
from base, indeed from despised materials? Will there be many who 
desire to pursue such researches? Mankind likes to put questions of ori­
gins and beginnings out of its mind: must one not be almost inhuman to 
detect in oneself a contrary inclination?-

Family failing of philosophers. -All philosophers have the common failing 
of starting out from man as he is now and thinking they can reach their 
goal through an analysis of him. They involuntarily think of 'man' as an 
aeterna veritas, t as something that remains constant in the midst of all 
flux, as a sure measure of things. Everything the philosopher has 
 thing-in-itself: Kant's term for objects as they are independently of our knowledge of 
them, contrasted (see section 10) with 'appearances', objects considered as conforming to our 
modes of knowing them 
t aeterna veritas: something everlastingly true

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OF FIRST AND LAST THINGS 
declared about man is, however, at bottom no more than a testimony as 
to the man of a very limited period of time. Lack of historical sense is the 
family failing of all philosophers; many, without being aware of it, even 
take the most recent manifestation of man,  such as has arisen under the 
impress of certain  religions, even certain political events, as the fixed 
form from which one has to start out. They will not learn that man has 
become, that the faculty of cognition has become; while some  of them 
would have it that the whole world is spun out of this faculty of cog­
nition. Now, everything essential in the development of mankind took 
place in primeval times, long before the four thousand years we more or 
less know about; during these years mankind may well not have altered 
very much. But the philosopher here sees 'instincts' in man as he now is 
and assumes that these belong to the unalterable facts of mankind and to 
that extent could provide a key to the understanding of the world in gen­
eral: the whole of teleology is constructed by speaking of the man of the 
last four millennia as of an eternal man towards whom all things in the 
world have had a natural relationship from the time he began. But every­
thing has become: there are no eternal facts, just as there are no absolute 
truths. Consequently what is needed from now on is historical philosophiz­
ing, and with it the virtue of modesty. 
3 
Estimation of unpretentious truths. -It  is the mark of a higher culture to 
value the little unpretentious truths which have been discovered by 
means of rigorous method more highly than the errors handed down by 
metaphysical and artistic ages and men, which blind us and make us 
happy. At first the former are regarded with scorn, as though the two 
things could not possibly be accorded equal rights: they stand there so 
modest, simple, sober, so apparently discouraging, while the latter are so 
fair, splendid, intoxicating, perhaps indeed enrapturing. Yet that which 
has been attained by laborious struggle, the certain, enduring and thus of 
significance for any further development of knowledge is nonetheless 
the higher; to adhere to it is manly and demonstrates courage, simplicity 
and abstemiousness. Gradually not only the individual but all mankind 
will be raised to this manliness, when they  have finally become accus­
tomed  to valuing  viable,  enduring knowledge more highly and lost all 
faith in inspiration and the acquisition of knowledge by miraculous 
means. -Worshippers of form, with their standards of the beautiful and 
sublime, will, to be sure, at first have good ground for mockery once esti­
mation of unpretentious truths and the scientific spirit begins  to domi­
nate: but only because either their eye has not yet discovered the charm 
of the simplest form or because those raised in that spirit are as yet very far 
from being thoroughly permeated by it,  so that they still thoughtlessly 
imitate old forms (and do so badly, as does everyone to whom a thing no 
longer matters very much). Formerly the spirit was not engaged in rigor­
ous  thinking, its serious occupation was the spinning out of forms and 
symbols. That has now changed; serious occupation with the symbolic 
13 Page 40
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN 
has become a mark of a lower culture. As our arts themselves grow ever 
more intellectual, our senses more spiritual, and as for example we now 
adjudge what is pleasant sounding quite differently from the way we did 
a hundred years ago: so the forms of our life will grow ever more spiritual, 
perhaps to the eye of earlier ages uglier, but only because it is incapable of 
seeing how the realm  of inner, spiritual  beauty is continually growing 
deeper and wider,  and to what extent we may all now accord the eye of 
insight greater value than the fairest structure or the sublimest edifice. 
4 
Astrology and what is related to it. -It is probable that the objects of there-
ligious,  moral and aesthetic sensations belong only to the surface of 
things, while man likes to believe that here at least he is in touch with the 
world's heart; the reason he deludes himself is that these things produce 
in him such profound happiness and unhappiness, and thus he exhibits 
here the same pride as in the case of astrology. For astrology believes the 
starry firmament revolves around the fate of man; the moral man, how­
ever, supposes that what he has essentially at heart must also constitute 
the essence and heart of things. 
5 
Misunderstanding of the dream. -The man of the ages of barbarous pri-
mordial  culture  believed that in the dream he was getting to know a 
second real world: here is the origin of all metaphysics. Without the dream 
one would have had no occasion to divide the world into two. The dissec­
tion into soul and body is also connected with the oldest idea of the 
dream,  likewise the postulation of a life of the soul,* thus the origin of all 
belief in spirits, and probably also of the belief in gods. 'The dead live on, 
for they appear to the living in dreams': that was the conclusion one for­
merly drew, throughout many millennia. 
6 
The spirit of science rules its parts, not the whole. -The separate smallest 
regions of science are treated purely objectively: the great universal 
sciences, on the other hand, viewed as a whole pose the question-a very 
unobjective question, to be sure -to what end? of what utility? On 
account of this regard for utility they are as a whole treated less imperson­
ally than  they are in their parts. And when it comes to philosophy, the 
summit of the entire scientific pyramid, we find the question as to the util­
ity of knowledge as such involuntarily raised, and the unconscious inten­
tion of every philosophy is to ascribe to it the highest utility. That is why 
there is in all philosophies so much high-flying metaphysics and such a 
dread of the explanations offered by physics, which seem so modest and 
insignificant; for the significance of knowledge for life has to appear as 
great as it possibly can. Here lies the antagonism between the individual 
regions of science and philosophy. The latter  wants, as art does, to 
bestow on life and action the greatest possible profundity and signifi-
 life of the soul: Seelenscheinleib, Nietzsche's coinage 
14 Page 41
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OF FIRST AND LAST THINGS 
cance; in the former one seeks knowledge and nothing further-and does 
in fact acquire it. There has hitherto been no philosopher in whose hands 
philosophy has  not become an apologia for knowledge; on this point at 
least each of them is an optimist, inasmuch as he believes that knowledge 
must be in the highest degree useful. They are all tyrannized over by 
logic: and logic is by its nature optimism. 
7 
The mischief-maker in science. -Philosophy separated itself from science 
when it posed the question: what kind of knowledge of the world and life 
is it through which man can live happiest? This took place in the Socratic 
schools: by having in view the objective of happiness one applied a liga­
ture to the arteries of scientific research-and does so still today. 
8 
Pneumatological elucidation of nature. -Metaphysics elucidates the hand­
writing of nature as it were pneumatologically,  as the church and its schol­
ars formerly did  the Bible. It requires a  great deal of understanding  to 
apply to nature the same kind of rigorous art of elucidation that philolo­
gists have now fashioned for all books: with the intention of compre­
hending what the text intends to say but  without sensing, indeed 
presupposing, a second meaning. But as even  with regard to books the 
bad art of elucidation has by no means been entirely overcome and one 
still continually encounters in the best educated circles remnants of alle­
gorical and mystical interpretations: so  it is also in respect to nature -
where, indeed, it is even far worse. 
9 
Metaphysical world. -It is true, there could be a metaphysical world; the 
absolute possibility of it is hardly to  be disputed. We behold all things 
through the human head and cannot cut off this head; while the question 
nonetheless remains what of the world would still be there if one had cut 
it off. This is a purely scientific problem and one not very well calculated 
to bother people overmuch; but all that has hitherto made metaphysical 
assumptions valuable, terrible, delightful to them, all that has  begotten 
these assumptions, is passion, error and self-deception; the worst of all 
methods of acquiring knowledge, not the best of all, have taught belief in 
them. When  one  has  disclosed these methods as the foundation of all 
extant religions and metaphysical systems, one has refuted them! Then 
that possibility still remains over; but one can do absolutely nothing with 
it, not to speak of letting happiness, salvation and life depend on the 
gossamer of such a possibility.- For one could assert nothing at all of the 
metaphysical world except that it was a being-other, an inaccessible, in­
comprehensible being-other; it would be a thing with negative qualities. 
-Even if the existence of such a world were never so well demonstrated, 
it is certain that knowledge of it would be the most useless of all 
 pneumatologically: pneumatology is the 'science' of spirits and spiritual beings Page 42
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN 
knowledge: more useless even than knowledge of the chemical compo­
sition of water must be to the sailor in danger of shipwreck. 
10 
Future innocuousness of metaphysics. -As soon as the origin of religion, art 
and  morality is so described  that it can be perfectly understood without 
the postulation of metaphysical interference at the commencement or in the 
course of their progress, the greater part of our interest in the  purely 
theoretical problem of the 'thing in itself' and 'appearance' ceases to exist. 
For with religion, art and morality we do not touch upon the 'nature of 
the world in itself'; we are in the realm of ideas, no 'intuition' can take us 
any further.  The question of how our conception of the world could differ 
so widely from the disclosed nature of the world will with perfect equa­
nimity be relinquished to the physiology and history of the evolution of 
organisms and concepts. 
11 
Language as putative science. -The significance of language for the evol­
ution of culture lies in this,  that mankind set up in language a separate 
world beside the other world, a place it took to be so firmly set that, stand­
ing upon it, it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself 
master of it. To the extent that man has for long ages believed in the con­
cepts and  names of things as in aeternae veritates he has appropriated to 
himself that pride by which he raised himself above the animal: he really 
thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world.  The 
sculptor of language was  not so modest as to believe that he  was only 
giving things designations, he conceived  rather that with words he was 
expressing supreme knowledge of things; language is, in fact, the first 
stage of the occupation with science.  Here, too, it is the belief that the truth 
has been found out of which the mightiest sources of energy have flowed. 
A great deal later -only now -it dawns on men that in their belief in 
language they have propagated a tremendous error.* Happily, it is too 
late for the evolution of reason, which depends on this belief, to be again 
put back. -Logic too depends on presuppositions with which nothing in 
the real world corresponds, for example on the presupposition that there 
are identical things, that the  same thing is identical at  different  points of 
time: but this science came  into existence through the opposite belief 
(that such conditions do obtain in the real world). It is the same with math­
ematics, which would certainly not have come into existence if one had 
known from the beginning that there was in nature no exactly straight 
line, no real circle, no absolute magnitude. 
12 
Dream and culture.-The function of the brain that sleep encroaches upon 
most is the  memory: not that it ceases altogether- but it is reduced to a 
condition of imperfection such as in the primeval ages of mankind may 
have been normal by day and in waking. Confused and capricious as it is, 
 Nietzsche had described this error in detail in Truth and Falsehood in the Extra·Mora/ Sense 
(1873)· 
16 Page 43
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OF FIRST AND LAST THINGS 
it continually confuses one  thing with another on the basis of the most 
fleeting similarities: but it was with the same confusion and capricious­
ness that the peoples composed their mythologies, and even today travel­
lers observe how much the savage is inclined to forgetfulness, how  his 
mind begins to reel and stumble after a brief exertion of the memory and 
he utters lies and nonsense out of mere enervation. But in dreams we all 
resemble this savage; failure to recognize correctly and erroneously sup­
posing one thing to be the same as another is the ground of the false con­
clusions of which we are guilty in dreams; so that, when we clearly recall 
a dream, we are  appalled  to  discover so much folly in ourselves. -The 
perfect clarity of all the  images we see in dreams which is the pre­
condition of our unquestioning belief in their reality again reminds us of 
conditions pertaining to earlier mankind, in whom hallucination  was 
extraordinarily common and sometimes seized hold on whole communi­
ties, whole peoples at the same time. Thus: in sleep and dreams we 
repeat once again the curriculum of earlier mankind.* 
13 
Logic of the dream.-In sleep our nervous system is continually agitated by 
a multiplicity of inner events, almost all our organs are active, our blood 
circulates vigorously, the position  of the sleeper presses on individual 
limbs, his bedcovers influence his sensibilities in various ways, his 
stomach digests and its motions disturb other organs, his intestines are 
active, the position of his head involves unusual muscular contortions, 
his feet, unshod and not pressing against the floor, produce an unfam­
iliar feeling, as does the difference in the way his whole body is clad-all 
this, through its unusualness and to a differing degree each day, excites 
the entire system up to the functioning of the brain; and so there are a 
hundred occasions for the mind to be involved in puzzlement and to look 
for grounds for this excitation: the dream is the seeking and positing of the 
causes of this excitement of the sensibilities, that is to say the supposed 
causes. If, for example, you tie two straps about your feet you may well 
dream that your feet are coiled round by snakes: this is first a hypothesis, 
then a belief, with an accompanying pictorial representation and the sup­
position: 'these snakes must be the causa of those sensations that I, the 
sleeper, feel'- thus the sleeper's mind judges. The immediate past he has 
thus inferred becomes through his aroused imagination the present to 
him.  Everyone knows from experience how quickly a dreamer entwines 
with his dream a sound that strongly impinges upon him from without, 
the ringing of bells or the firing of cannon, for example; that is to say, he 
accounts  for the sound in terms of the dream, so that he believes he 
experiences the cause of the sound first, then the sound itself. -But how 
does it come about that the dreamer's mind always blunders like this, 
 In The Interpretation of Dreams, ch. VII (B), Freud writes: 'We can guess how much to the 
point is Nietzsche's assertion that in dreams "some primeval relic of humanity is at work 
which we can now scarcely reach any longer by a direct path"; and we may expect that the 
analysis of dreams will lead us to a knowledge of man's archaic heritage, of what is psychologi­
cally innate in him.' Page 44
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN 
when the same mind is accustomed to be so sober, cautious and so scepti­
cal with regard to hypotheses while it is awake?- so that the first plaus­
ible hypothesis for explaining a  sensation that occurs to him is at once 
accepted as the truth? (For in dreams we believe in the dream as though it 
were reality, that is to say we regard our hypothesis as completely 
proved.)-In my opinion, the conclusions man still draws in dreams to 
the present day for many millennia mankind also drew when  awake: the 
first causa that entered the mind as an explanation of anything that 
required explaining satisfied  it and was accounted truth. (According to 
travellers' tales savages still do this today.) In the dream this  piece of pri­
meval humanity continues to exercise itself, for it is the basis upon which 
higher rationality evolved and continues to evolve in every human being: 
the dream takes us back again to remote stages of human culture and pro­
vides us with  a means of understanding them better. We  now find 
dream-thinking* so easy because it is in precisely this imaginative and 
agreeable form of explanation by means of the first plausible idea that 
strikes us that we have been so well drilled over such enormous periods 
of human evolution. To this extent the dream is a relaxation for the brain, 
which has had enough of the strenuous demands in the way of thinking 
such as are imposed by our  higher  culture  during the day. -A related 
occurrence which stands as portal  and entrance-hall of the dream can 
actually be observed in full wakefulness. If we close our eyes, the brain 
produces a host of light-impressions and colours, probably as a kind of 
after-play and echo of those effects of light which crowd in upon it during 
the day. Now, however, the reason (in alliance with the imagination) at 
once assembles these in themselves formless colour-impressions into 
definite figures, shapes, landscapes, moving groups. What is actually 
occurring is again a kind of inferring of the cause from the effect; the mind 
asks where these light-impressions and colours come from and supposes 
these shapes and figures are their causes: it regards them as occasioning 
these lights  and  colours because, by day and with eyes open, it is accus­
tomed to finding that every  colour,  every  light-impression  does  in  fact 
have a cause that occasions  it. Here, then, the imagination is continually 
providing the mind with images borrowed from the sight-impressions of 
the day, and this is precisely the  way in  which  it fashions the dream­
fantasy:-that is to say, the supposed cause is inferred from the effect and 
introduced after the effect: and all with extraordinary rapidity, so that, as 
with a conjurer, a confusion of judgement can here arise and successive 
events appear as simultaneous events or eve_n with the order of their 
occurrence reversed.-These facts show us how late more rigorous logical 
thinking, a clear perception of the  nature of cause and effect, must have 
been evolved  if our faculties of reason and understanding even now invol­
untarily grasp at those primitive forms of conclusion and  inference and 
we still live about  half of our life in  this condition. -The poet and the 
artist, too, foists upon his moods and states of mind causes which are cer-
 dream-thinking: Traumdenken

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OF FIRST AND LAST THINGS 
tainly not the true ones; to this extent he recalls an earlier humanity and 
can aid us to an understanding of it. 
14 
Sympathetic resonance.-All stronger moods bring with them a sympathetic 
resonance on the part of related sensations and moods: they as it were 
root up the memory. Something in  us  is provoked to recollection and 
becomes aware of similar states and their origins. Thus there come to be 
constructed habitual rapid connections between feelings and thoughts 
which, if they succeed one another with lightning speed, are in the end 
no longer experienced as complexes but as unities. It is in this sense that 
one speaks of the moral feelings, of the religious feelings, as though these 
were simple unities: in truth, however, they are rivers with a hundred 
tributaries and sources. Here too, as so often, the unity of the word is no 
guarantee of the unity of the thing. 
15 
No inner and outer in the world. -As Democritus transferred the concepts 
Above and Below to infinite space, where they make no sense, so philos­
ophers in general transfer the concept 'inner and outer' to the essence 
and phenomena of the world; they believe that profound feelings take 
one deep into the interior, close to the heart of nature. But such feelings 
are profound only insofar as when they occur certain complex groups of 
thoughts which we call profound are, scarcely perceptibly, regularly 
aroused with them; a feeling is profound because we regard the thoughts 
that accompany it as profound. But a profound thought can nonetheless 
be very distant from the truth, as, for example, every metaphysical 
thought is; if one deducts from the profound feeling  the element of 
thought mixed in with it, what remains is the strong feeling, and this has 
nothing to do with knowledge as such, just as strong belief demonstrates 
only its strength, not the truth of that which is believed. 
16 
Appearance and thing in itself. -Philosophers are accustomed to station 
themselves before life and experience -before that which they call the 
world of appearance -as before a painting that has been unrolled once 
and for all and unchangeably depicts the same scene: this scene, they be­
lieve, has to be correctly interpreted, so as to draw a conclusion as to the 
nature of the being that produced the picture: that is to say, as to the 
nature of the thing in itself, which it is customary to regard as the suf­
ficient reasont for the existence of the world of appearance. As against 
this, more rigorous logicians, having clearly identified the concept of the 
metaphysical as  that of the unconditioned, consequently also uncon­
ditioning, have disputed any connection between the unconditioned (the 
metaphysical world) and the world we know: so that what appears in

Socratic' philosophers

ground' and 'every event has a cause'; Schopenhauer discussed the history and justification of 
the prindple in The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (1813). Page 46
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN 
appearance is precisely not the thing in itself, and no conclusion can be 
drawn from the former as to the nature of the latter. Both parties, how­
ever, overlook the possibility that this painting-that which we humans 
call  life and experience -has gradually become, is indeed still fully in 
course of becoming, and should thus not be regarded as a fixed object on 
the basis of which a conclusion as to the nature of its originator (the suf­
ficient reason) may either be drawn or pronounced undrawable. Because 
we have for millennia made moral, aesthetic, religious demands on the 
world, looked upon it with blind desire, passion or fear, and abandoned 
ourselves to the bad habits of illogical thinking, this world has gradually 
become so marvellously variegated, frightful, meaningful, soulful, it has 
acquired colour-but we have been the colourists: it is the human intellect 
that has made appearance appear and transported its erroneous basic 
conceptions into things. Late, very late -it has reflected on all this: and 
now the world of experience and the thing in itself seem to it so extraordi· 
narily different from one another and divided apart that it rejects the idea 
that the nature of one can be inferred from the nature of the other - or 
invites us in a chillingly mysterious fashion to abandon our intellect, our 
personal will: so as to attain to the real by becoming real oneself. Others 
again have  assembled all  the characteristic traits of  our world of 
appearance-that is to say, the idea of the world spun out of intellectual 
errors we have inherited-and, instead of indicting the intellect as the guilty 
party, have charged the essence of things with being the cause of the very 
uncanny character  this  world  in fact possesses and have preached 
redemption from being. -With all these  conceptions the steady and la­
borious process of science, which will one day celebrate its greatest tri­
umph in a history of the genesis of thought, will in the end decisively have 
done; for the outcome of this history may well be the conclusion: That 
which we now call the world is the outcome of a host of errors and fan­
tasies which have gradually arisen and grown entwined  with one 
another in the course of the overall evolution of the organic being, and 
are now inherited by us as the accumulated treasure of the entire past-as 
treasure: for the value of our humanity depends upon it. Rigorous 
science is capable of detaching us from this ideational world only to a 
limited extent- and more is certainly not to be desired- inasmuch as it is 
incapable of making any essential inroad into the power of habits of feel­
ing  acquired in primeval times: but it can, quite gradually and step by 
step, illuminate the history of the genesis of this world as idea-and, for 
brief periods at any rate, lift us up out of the entire proceeding. Perhaps 
we  shall then recognize  that the thing in itself is worthy of Homeric 
laughter: that it appeared to be so much,  indeed  everything, and is 
actually empty,  that is to say empty of significance. 
17 
Metaphysical explanations. -The young person values metaphysical expla­
nations because they reveal to him something in the highest degree sig­
nificant in things he found unpleasant or contemptible; and if he is 
20 Page 47
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OF FIRST AND LAST THINGS 
discontented with himself this feeling is alleviated when he comes to rec­
ognize the innermost enigma or misery of the universe in that which he 
so much condemns in himself. To feel more irresponsible and at the same 
time to find things more interesting-that is the twofold benefit for which 
he believes he has metaphysics to thank. Later on, to be sure, he acquires 
mistrust of the whole metaphysical mode of explanation; then perhaps 
he sees that the effects he has experienced are to be attained equally well 
and more scientifically by another route: that physical and historical ex­
planations produce that feeling of irresponsibility at least as well, and 
that interest in life and its problems is perhaps enflamed even more by 
them. 
18 
Fundamental questions of metaphysics. -When one day the history of the 
genesis of thought comes to be written, the following sentence by a dis­
tinguished logician will also stand revealed in a new light: 'The primary 
universal law of the knowing subject consists in the inner necessity of 
recognizing every object in itself as being in its own essence something 
identical with itself, thus self-existent and at bottom always the same and 
unchanging, in short as a substance'. This law, too, which is here called 
'primary', evolved: one day it will be shown how gradually, in the lower 
organisms, this tendency comes into being: how the purblind mole's eyes 
of this organization at first never see anything but the same thing; how 
then, when the various pleasurable and unpleasurable stimuli become 
more noticeable, various different substances are gradually dis­
tinguished, but each of them with one attribute, that is to say a single re­
lationship with such an organism. -The first stage of the logical is the 
judgement: and the essence of the judgement consists, according to the 
best logicians, in belief. At the bottom of all belief there lies the sensation of 
the pleasurable or painful in respect to the  subject experiencing the sen­
sation. A new, third sensation as a product of two preceding single sen­
sations is the judgement in its lowest form. --In our primary condition, all 
that interests us organic beings in any thing is its relationship to us in 
respect of pleasure and pain. Between the moments in which we become 
conscious of this relationship, the states of awareness of sensation, lie 
those of repose, of non-sensation: then the world and every thing is 
devoid of interest to us, we notice no alteration in it (just as now anyone 
absorbed with interest in something will still not notice someone walking 
by him). To the plants all things are usually in repose, eternal, every 
thing identical with itself.  It is from the period of the lower organisms 
that man has inherited the belief that there are identical  things (only 
knowledge educated in the highest scientificality contradicts this prop­
osition). It may even be that the original belief of everything organic was 
from the very beginning that all the rest of the world is one and unmov­
ing. -What lies farthest from this primeval stage of the logical is the 
notion of causality: even now, indeed, we believe at bottom that all sen­
sations and actions are acts of free will; when the sentient individuum 
21 Page 48
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN 
observes itself, it regards every sensation, every change, as something 
isolated, that is to say unconditioned, disconnected: it emerges out of us 
independently of anything earlier or later. We are hungry, but originally 
we do not think that  the organism  wants to sustain itself; this feeling 
seems to be asserting itself without cause or purpose, it isolates itself and 
considers itself willful. Thus: belief in freedom of will is a primary error 
committed by everything organic, as old as the impulse to  the logical 
itself;  belief in unconditioned substances and in identical things is like­
wise a primary, ancient error committed by everything organic. Insofar, 
however, as all metaphysics has had principally to do with substance and 
freedom of will, one may designate it the science that treats of the funda­
mental errors of mankind-but does so as though they were fundamental 
truths. 
19 
Number.-The invention of the laws of numbers was made on the basis of 
the error, dominant even from the earliest times, that there are identical 
things (but in fact nothing is identical with anything  else); at least that 
there are things (but there is no 'thing'). The assumption of plurality 
always  presupposes the existence of something that occurs more than 
once: but  precisely here error  already  holds sway, here already we are 
fabricating beings, unities which do not exist. - Our sensations of space 
and  time are false, for tested consistently they lead to logical contradic­
tions. The establishment of conclusions in science always unavoidably 
involves us in calculating with  certain false magnitudes: but because 
these magnitudes are at least constant, as for example are our sensations 
of time and space, the conclusions of science acquire a complete rigorous­
ness and certainty in their coherence with one another; one can build on 
them -up to that  final  stage at which our erroneous basic assumptions, 
those constant errors, come to be incompatible with our conclusions, for 
example in the theory of atoms. Here we continue to feel ourselves com­
pelled to assume the existence of a 'thing' or material 'substratum' which 
is moved, while the whole procedure of science has pursued the task of 
resolving everything thing-like (material) in motions: here too our sen­
sations divide that which moves from that which is moved, and we 
cannot get out of this circle because our belief in the existence of things 
has been tied up with our being from time immemorial. -When Kant says 
'the understanding does not draw its laws from nature, it prescribes them 
to nature', this is wholly true with regard to the concept of nature which we 
are obliged to attach to nature (nature = world as idea, that is as error), 
but which is the summation of a host of errors of the understanding. -To 
a world  which is not our idea the laws of numbers are wholly inapplic­
able: these are valid only in the human world. 
20 
A few steps back. - One,  certainly very high level of culture has  been 
attained when a man emerges from superstitious and religious concepts 
and fears and no longer believes in angels, for example, or in original sin, 
22 Page 49

and has ceased to speak of the salvation of souls: if he is at this level of lib­
eration he now has, with the greatest exertion of mind, to overcome 
metaphysics. Then, however, he needs to take a retrograde step: he has to 
grasp the historical justification that resides in such ideas, likewise the 
psychological; he has to recognize that they have been most responsible 
for the advancement of mankind and that without such a retrograde step 
he will deprive himself of the best that mankind has hitherto produced. -
In regard to philosophical  metaphysics,  I see more and more who are 
making for the  negative goal (that all positive metaphysics is an error), 
but still few who are taking a few steps back; for one may well want to 
look out over the topmost rung of the ladder, but one ought not to want 
to stand on it. The most enlightened get only as far as liberating them­
selves from metaphysics and looking back on it from above: whereas here 
too, as in the hippodrome, at the end of the track it is necessary to turn 
the corner. 
21 
Probable victory of scepticism. -Let us for once accept the validity of the 
sceptical point of departure: if there were no other, metaphysical world 
and all explanations of the only world known to us drawn from meta­
physics were useless to us, in what light would we then regard men and 
things? This question can be thought through, and it is valuable to do so, 
even if we do for once ignore the question whether the existence of any­
thing metaphysical has been scientifically demonstrated by Kant and 
Schopenhauer. For the historical probability is that one day mankind will 
very possibly become in general and on the whole sceptical in this matter; 
thus the question becomes: what shape will human society then assume 
under the influence of such an attitude of mind? Perhaps the scientific 
demonstration of the existence of any kind of metaphysical world is 
already so difficult that mankind will never again be free of a mistrust of it. 
And if one has a mistrust of metaphysics the results are by and large the 
same as if it had been directly refuted and one no longer had the right to 
believe in it. The historical question in regard to an unmetaphysical atti­
tude of mind on the part of mankind remains the same in both cases. 
22 
Disbelief in the 'monumentum aere perennius'. *-An essential disadvantage 
which the cessation of the metaphysical outlook brings with it lies in the 
fact that the attention of the individual is too firmly fixed on his own brief 
span of life and receives no stronger impulse to work at the construction 
of enduring institutions intended to last for centuries; he wants to pluck 
the fruit himself from the tree he plants, and he is therefore no longer 
interested in planting those trees which demand constant tending for a 
century and are intended to provide shade for long successions of gener­
ations. For the metaphysical outlook bestows the belief that it offers the 
last, ultimate foundation upon which the whole future of mankind is 
then invited to establish and construct itself; the individual is promoting 
' 'monumentum aere perennius': a memorial longer lasting than bronze (Horace) 
23 Page 50

his salvation when, for example, he founds a church or a convent, he 
thinks it will be accounted to his credit and rewarded in the eternal future 
life of his soul, it is a contribution to the eternal  salvation of the soul. -
Can science, too, awaken such faith in its  conclusions? The fact is that 
science needs  doubt and distrust for its closest allies;  nonetheless, the 
sum of unimpeachable truths -truths, that is, which have survived all 
the assaults of scepticism and disintegration-can in time become so great 
(in the dietetics of health, for example) that on the basis of them one may 
resolve to embark on 'everlasting' works. In the meanwhile, the contrast 
between our agitated ephemeral existence and the slow-breathing repose 
of metaphysical ages is still too strong, because the two ages are still too 
close together; the individual human being himself now runs through far 
too many inner and outer evolutions for him to venture to establish him­
self securely and once and for all even for so short a span as his own life­
time. A  completely  modern man who wants, for example, to build 
himself a house  has at the same time the feeling he is  proposing to 
immure himself alive in a mausoleum. 
23 
Age of comparison. -The less men are bound by tradition, the greater is the 
fermentation of motivations within them, and the greater in consequence 
their outward restlessness, their mingling together with one another, the 
polyphony of their endeavours. Who is there who now still feels a strong 
compulsion to attach himself and his posterity to a particular place? Who 
is there who still feels any strong attachment at all? Just as in the arts all 
the genres are imitated side by side, so are all the stages and genres of 
morality, custom, culture.- Such an age acquires its significance through 
the fact that in it the various different philosophies of life, customs, cul­
tures can be compared and experienced side by side; which in earlier 
ages, when, just as all artistic genres were attached to a particular place 
and time, so every culture still enjoyed only a localized domination, was 
not possible. Now an enhanced aesthetic sensibility will come to a defini­
tive decision between all these forms offering themselves for comparison: 
most of them-namely all those rejected by this sensibility - it will allow 
to die out. There is likewise now taking place a selecting out among the 
forms and customs of higher morality whose objective can only be the 
elimination of the lower moralities. This is the age of comparison! It is the 
source of its pride-but,  as is only reasonable, also of its suffering. Let us 
not be afraid of  this suffering! Let us rather confront the  task  which the 
age sets us as boldly as we can: and then posterity will bless us for it - a 
posterity that will know itself to  be as much beyond the self-enclosed 
original national  cultures as it is beyond the culture of comparison, but 
will look back upon both species of culture as upon venerable antiquities. 
24 
Possibility of progress. - When a scholar of the old culture swears to have 
nothing more to do with people who believe in progress he is right.  For 
the old culture has its goods and greatness behind it and history compels Page 51
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OF FIRST AND LAST THINGS 
one to admit that it can never be fresh again; one needs to be intolerably 
stupid or fanatical to deny this. But men are capable of consciously resolv­
ing to evolve themselves to a new culture, whereas formerly they did so 
unconsciously and fortuitously: they can now create better conditions for 
the propagation of men and for their nutrition, education and instruc­
tion, manage the earth as a whole economically, balance and employ the 
powers of men in general. This new, conscious culture destroys the old, 
which viewed as a whole has led an unconscious animal-and plant-life; it 
also destroys mistrust of progress-it is possible. It would, of course, be 
rash and almost nonsensical to believe that progress must necessarily 
follow; but how could it be denied that progress is possible? On the other 
hand, progress in the sense and along the paths of the old culture is not 
even thinkable. If romantic fantasizings still do designate their goals (e.g. 
self-contained original national cultures) as 'progress', they nonetheless 
borrow their image of it from the past: in this domain their thinking and 
imagining lacks all originality. 
25 
Private and public morality. -Since the belief has ceased that a God broadly 
directs the destinies of the world and that, all the apparent twists and 
turns in its path notwithstanding, is leading mankind gloriously upward, 
man has to set himself ecumenical goals embracing the whole earth. The 
former morality, namely Kant's, demanded  of the individual actions 
which one desired of all men: that was a very naive thing; as if everyone 
knew without further ado what mode of action would benefit the whole 
of mankind, that is, what actions at all are desirable; it is a theory like that 
of free trade, presupposing that universal harmony must result of itself in 
accordance with innate laws of progress. Perhaps some future survey of 
the requirements of mankind will show that it is absolutely not desirable 
that all men should act in the same way, but rather that in the interest of 
ecumenical goals whole tracts of mankind ought to have special, perhaps 
under certain circumstances even evil tasks imposed upon them. -In any 
event, if mankind is not to destroy itself through such conscious univer­
sal rule, it must first of all attain to a hitherto altogether unprecedented 
knowledge of the preconditions of culture as a scientific standard for ecumeni­
cal goals. Herein lies the tremendous task facing the great spirits of the 
coming century. 
26 
Reaction as progress. -Sometimes there appear blunt and forceful spirits 
capable of exciting great enthusiasm whose development is nonetheless 
retarded, so that they conjure up again an earlier phase of mankind: they 
serve to prove that the modern tendencies against which they act are not 
yet strong enough, that there is something lacking in them: otherwise the 
latter would be able to offer better resistance to these conjurers. Thus 
Luther's Reformation, for example, witnesses that in his century all the 
impulses to freedom of spirit were still uncertain, tender and youthful; 
science was  as yet unable to raise its head. The whole Renaissance, 
25 Page 52
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN 
indeed, seems like an early spring almost snowed away again. But in our 
century, too, Schopenhauer's metaphysics demonstrates that even now 
the scientific  spirit is not yet sufficiently strong: so that, although all the 
dogmas of Christianity have long since been demolished, the whole 
medieval Christian conception of the world and of the nature of man 
could in Schopenhauer's teaching celebrate a resurrection. Much science 
resounds in his teaching, but what dominates it is not science but the old 
familiar 'metaphysical need'. One of the greatest, indeed quite invaluable 
advantages we derive from Schopenhauer is that through him our sensi­
bilities are for a time compelled to return to older ways of contemplating 
the world and mankind that once held sway which we would otherwise 
have no easy access to. The gain for historical justice is very great: I be­
lieve that no one would find it easy to do justice to Christianity and its 
Asiatic  relations without Schopenhauer' s  assistance:  on the basis  of 
present-day Christianity alone it would be quite impossible. Only after 
this great triumph of justice, only after we have corrected the mode of his­
torical interpretation introduced by the Age of Enlightenment on so es­
sential a point as this, may we bear the banner of the Enlightenment-the 
banner bearing the three names  Petrach, * Erasmus, t Voltaire -further 
onward. Out of reaction we have created progress. 
27 
Substitute for religion. -One believes one is  commending  a philosophy 
when one presents it as a popular substitute for religion. The economy of 
the spirit does indeed occasionally require transitional orders of ideas; 
thus the passage from religion to a scientific mode of thought is a violent 
and perilous leap,  something to be advised against.  To that extent this 
recommendation of a philosophy is justified. But in the end one also has 
to understand that the needs which religion has satisfied and philosophy 
is now supposed to satisfy are not immutable; they can be weakened and 
exterminated. Consider,  for example, that Christian distress of mind that 
comes from sighing over one's  inner depravity and care for one's sal­
vation -all conceptions originating in nothing but errors of reason and 
deserving, not satisfaction, but obliteration. A philosophy can be 
employed either to satisfy such needs or to set them aside; for they are 
acquired, time-bound needs resting on presuppositions that contradict 
those of science. To effect a transition here, to relieve the heart overladen 
with feeling, it is much more useful to employ art; for those conceptions 
we have spoken of will be nourished far less by art than they will be by a 
metaphysical philosophy. From art it will then be easier to go over to a 
truly liberating philosophical science. 
28 
Words in bad odour. -Away with those overused words optimism and 
pessimism! We have had enough of them. Occasion for  using them is 
growing less day by day; it is only idle chatterers who still have such an

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OF FIRST AND LAST THINGS 
indispensable need of them. For why in the world should anyone want to 
be an optimist if he does not have  to  defend a  God who has to  have 
created the best of worlds if he himself is goodness and perfection -but 
what thinker still has need of the hypothesis of a God?-But any occasion 
for a pessimistic creed is likewise lacking, unless one has an interest in 
provoking the advocates of God, the theologians or the theologizing phil­
osophers, and forcefully asserting the opposite point of view: that evil 
reigns, that there exists more pain than pleasure, that the world is an arti­
fice, the apparition of an evil will to live. But who still bothers about theo­
logians -except other theologians? -Disregarding theology and 
opposition to theology, it is quite obvious that the world is neither good 
nor evil, let alone the best of all or the worst of all worlds, and that these 
concepts 'good' and 'evil' possess meaning only when applied to men, 
and perhaps even here are, as they are usually employed, unjustified: in 
any event, we  must cast off both that conception of the world that 
inveighs against it and that which glorifies it. 
29 
Drunk with the odour of blossoms. -The ship of mankind has, one believes, a 
deeper and deeper draught the more heavily it is laden; one believes that 
the more profoundly a man thinks, the more tenderly he feels, the more 
highly he rates himself, the greater the distance grows between him and 
the other animals -the more he appears as the genius among animals­
the closer he will get to the true nature of the world and to a knowledge of 
it: this he does in fact do through science, but he thinks he does so even 
more through his arts and religions. These are, to be sure, a blossom of 
the world, but they are certainly not closer to the roots of the world than the 
stern is: they provide us with no better understanding of the nature of 
things at all, although almost everyone believes they do. It is error that 
has made mankind so profound,  tender,  inventive as to produce such a 
flower as the arts and religions. Pure  knowledge would have been in­
capable of it. Anyone who unveiled to us the nature of the world would 
produce for all of us the most unpleasant disappointment. It is not the 
world as thing in itself, it is the world as idea (as error) that is so full of sig­
nificance, profound, marvellous, and bearing in its womb all happiness 
and unhappiness. This consequence  leads to a philosophy of logical 
world-denial: which can, however, be united with a  practical world­
affirmation just as easily as with its opposite. 
30 
Bad habits in drawing conclusions. -The commonest erroneous conclusions 
drawn by mankind are these: a thing exists, therefore it has a right to. 
Here the conclusion is from the capacity to live to the fitness to live, from 
the fitness to live to the right to live. Then: an opinion makes happy, 
therefore it is a true opinion, its effect is good, therefore it itself is good 
and true. Here the effect is accorded the predicate beneficent, good, in 
the sense of useful, and then the cause is furnished with the same predi­
cate good, but here in the sense of the logically valid. The reverse of these Page 54
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN 
propositions is: a thing cannot prevail, preserve itself, therefore it is 
wrong; an opinion causes pain and agitation, therefore it is false. The free 
spirit, who is all too often acquainted with the erroneousness of this kind 
of reasoning and has to suffer from its consequences, often succumbs to 
the temptation to draw the opposite conclusions, which are of course in 
general equally erroneous: a thing cannot prevail, therefore it is good; an 
opinion causes pain and distress, therefore it is true. 
31 The illogical necessary. -Among the things that can reduce a thinker to 
despair is the knowledge that the illogical is a necessity for mankind, and 
that  much  good proceeds from the illogical. It is implanted so firmly in 
the passions, in language, in art, in religion, and in general in everything 
that lends  value to life, that one cannot  pull it out of these fair things 
without mortally injuring them. Only very naive people are capable of be­
lieving that the nature of man could be transformed into a purely logical 
one; but if there should be degrees of approximation to this objective, 
what would not have to be lost if this course were taken! Even the most 
rational man from time to time needs to recover nature, that is to say his 
illogical original relationship with all things. 
32 
Injustice necessary. -All judgements as to the value of life have evolved 
illogically and are therefore unjust. The  falsity  of human judgement 
derives firstly from the condition of the material to be judged, namely 
very incomplete, secondly from the way in which the sum is arrived at on 
the basis of this material, and thirdly from the fact that every individual 
piece of this material is in tum the outcome of false knowledge, and is so 
with absolute necessity. Our experience of another person, for example, 
no matter how close he stands to us, can never be complete, so that we 
would have a logical right to a total evaluation of him; all evaluations are 
premature and are bound to be. Finally, the standard by which we 
measure, our own being, is not an unalterable magnitude, we are subject 
to moods and fluctuations, and yet we would have to know ourselves as a 
fixed standard to be able justly to assess the relation between ourself and 
anything else whatever.  Perhaps it would follow from all this that one 
ought  not to judge at all; if only it were possible to live without evalu­
ating, without having aversions and partialities! -for all aversion is de­
pendent on an evaluation, likewise all partiality. A drive to something or 
away from something divorced from a feeling one is desiring the ben­
eficial or avoiding the harmful,  a drive without some kind of knowing 
evaluation of the worth of its objective, does not exist in man. We are 
from the very beginning illogical and thus unjust beings and can recognize 
this: this is one of the greatest and most irresolvable discords of existence. 
33 
Error regarding life necessary to life. -Every belief in the value and dignity of 
life rests on false thinking; it is possible only through the fact that empa-
28 Page 55
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OF FIRST AND LAST THINGS 
thy with the universal life and suffering of mankind is very feebly devel­
oped in the individual. Even those rarer men who think beyond 
themselves at all have an eye, not for this universal life, but for fenced-off 
portions of it. If one knows how to keep the exceptions principally in 
view, I mean the greatly gifted and pure of soul, takes their production 
for the goal of world-evolution and rejoices in the effects they in turn pro­
duce, one may believe in the value of life, because then one is overlooking 
all other men: thinking falsely, that is to say.  And likewise if, though one 
does keep in view all mankind, one accords validity only to one species of 
drives, the less egoistical, and justifies them in face of all the others, then 
again one can hope for something of mankind as a whole and to this 
extent believe in the value of life: thus, in this case too, through falsity of 
thinking. Whichever of these attitudes one adopts, however, one is by 
adopting it an exception among men. The  great majority endure life 
without complaining overmuch; they believe in the value of existence, but 
they do so precisely because each of them exists for himself alone, refus­
ing to step out of himself as those exceptions do: everything outside 
themselves they notice not at all or at most as a dim shadow. Thus for the 
ordinary, everyday man the value of life rests solely on the fact that he 
regards himself more highly than he does the world. The great lack of im­
agination from which he suffers means he is unable to feel his way into 
other beings and thus he participates as little as possible in their fortunes 
and sufferings. He, on the other hand, who really could participate in 
them would have to despair of the value of life; if he succeeded in encom­
passing and feeling within himself the total consciousness of mankind he 
would collapse with a curse on existence - for mankind has as a whole no 
goal, and  the individual man when he regards its total course cannot 
derive from it any support or comfort, but must be reduced to despair. If 
in all he does he has before him the ultimate goallessness of man, his 
actions acquire in his own eyes the character of useless squandering. But 
to feel thus squandered, not merely as an individual but as humanity as a 
whole, in the way we behold the individual fruits of nature squandered, 
is a feeling beyond all other feelings. -But who is capable of such a feel­
ing? Certainly only a poet: and poets always know how to console them­
selves. 
34 In mitigation. -But will our philosophy not  thus become a tragedy? Will 
truth not become inimical to life, to the better man? A question seems to 
lie heavily on our tongue and yet refuses to be uttered: whether one could 
consciously reside in untruth? or, if one were obliged to,  whether death 
would not be preferable? For there is no longer any 'ought'; for morality, 
insofar as it was an 'ought', has been just as much annihilated by our 
mode of thinking as has religion. Knowledge can allow as motives only 
pleasure and pain, utility and injury: but how will these motives come to 
terms with the sense for truth? For they too are in contact with errors 
(insofar as inclination and aversion and their very unjust assessments Page 56
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN 
are, as we said, the essential determinants of pleasure and pain). The 
whole of human life is sunk deeply in untruth; the individual cannot 
draw it up out of this  well without thereby growing profoundly  disil­
lusioned about his own past, without finding his present motives, such 
as that of honour, absurd, and pouring mockery and contempt on the 
passions which reach out to the future and promise happiness in it. Is it 
true, is all that remains a mode of thought whose outcome on a personal 
level is despair and on a theoretical level a philosophy of destruction?- I 
believe that the nature of the after-effect of knowledge is determined by a 
man's temperament: in addition to the after-effect described I could just as 
easily imagine a different one,  quite possible in individual instances, by 
virtue of which a life could  arise  much simpler and emotionally cleaner 
than our present life is: so that, though the old motives of violent desire 
produced by inherited habit would still possess their strength, they 
would gradually grow weaker under the influence of purifying knowl­
edge. In the end one would live among men and with oneself as in nature, 
without praising, blaming, contending, gazing contentedly, as though at 
a spectacle, upon many things for which one formerly felt only fear. One 
would be free of emphasis, and no longer prodded by the idea that one is 
only nature or more than nature. For this to happen one  would, to be 
sure,  have to possess the requisite temperament, as has already been 
said: a firm, mild and  at bottom cheerful soul, a temper that  does not 
need to be on its guard against malice or sudden outbursts and in whose 
utterances  there is nothing of snarling and sullenness -those familiar 
tedious qualities of old dogs and men who have long been kept on the 
leash. A man from whom the ordinary fetters of life have fallen to such an 
extent that he continues to live only so as to know better must, rather, 
without envy or vexation be able to forgo much, indeed almost every­
thing upon which other men place value; that free, fearless hovering over 
men, customs, laws and the traditional evaluations of things must suffice 
him as the condition he considers most desirable. He is happy to com­
municate his joy in this condition, and he has, perhaps, nothing else to 
communicate -which involves, to be sure, one more privation and re­
nunciation. If more is nonetheless desired of him, he will, with a benevol­
ent  shake of the head, point to his brother, the free man of action, and 
perhaps not conceal a certain mockery in doing  so: for of his 'freedom' 
there is a curious tale still to be told.
